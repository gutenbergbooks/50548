<h2>THE PREFACE</h2>


<p>The material out of which the child pictures history lies
all about him. When he learns to handle objects or observes
men and other beings act, he is gathering material to form
images for the stories you tell him, or those he reads. So
supple and vigorous is the child's imagination that he can put
this store of material to use in picturing a fairy story, a legend,
or a myth.</p>

<p>From this same source&mdash;his observation of the people
and things about him&mdash;he gathers simple meanings and ideas
of his own. He weaves these meanings and ideas, in part,
into the stories he reads or is told. From the cradle to the
grave he should exercise this habit of testing the men and
institutions he studies by a comparison with those he has seen.</p>

<p>The teacher should use the stories in this book to impress
upon the pupil's mind the idea that life is a constant struggle
against opposing difficulties. The pupil should be able to
see that the great men of American history spent their lives
in a ceaseless effort to conquer obstacles. For everywhere
men find opponents. What a struggle Lincoln had against
the twin difficulties of poverty and ignorance! What a battle
Roosevelt waged with timidity and a sickly boyhood!
And what a tremendously courageous and vigorous man he
became!</p>

<p>In the fight which men wage for noble or ignoble ends
the pupil finds his greatest source of interest. Here he forms
his ideas of right and wrong, and deals out praise and blame
among the characters. Hence the need of presenting true
Americans&mdash;patriotic Americans&mdash;for his study.</p>

<p>This book of American history includes the stirring scenes
of the world's greatest war. It shows how a vast nation,
loving peace and hating war, worked to get ready to fight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
how it trained its soldiers and planned a great navy, and how,
when all was ready, it hurled two million men against the
Germans and helped our brave allies to crush the cruelest foe
that war ever let loose.</p>

<p>With the knowledge of American men and events which
the study of our history should give him, the pupil is ready
to ask where the first Americans came from. To answer that
question, and many others, we must go to European history.
We must look at the great peoples of the world's earlier history,
and see how their civilization finally developed into that which
those colonists who pushed across the Atlantic to America
brought with them.</p>

<p>But the civilization brought to this country by earlier
or by later comers must not cease to grow. America has
her part to add to its development. With the close of the
World War we must not forget one fact which that conflict
brought out&mdash;the vast number of people in the United States
almost untouched by the spirit of American institutions.
Teachers of history, the subject-matter of which is the story of
American institutions and American leaders, can do much to
change such conditions. This need for more thorough Americanization
they can help to fill by teaching in their classes
not a mechanical patriotism but a loyal understanding of
American ideals.</p>

<h3>LEIF ERICSON, WHO DISCOVERED VINLAND</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Northmen
discover
Iceland
and
Greenland</strong></div>


<p><strong>1. The Voyages of the Northmen.</strong> The Northmen
were a bold seafaring people who lived in northern
Europe hundreds of years ago. Some of the very boldest
once sailed so far to the west that they reached the
shores of Iceland and Greenland, where many of them
settled. Among these were Eric the Red and his son
Leif Ericson.</p>

<p>Now Leif had heard of a land to the south of Greenland
from some Northmen who had been driven far south
in a great storm. He determined to set out in search
of it. After sailing for many days he reached the shore of
this New World (<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1000). There he found vines with
grapes on them growing so abundantly that he called
the new land Vinland, a country of grapes.</p>

<p>Leif's discovery caused great excitement among his
people. Some of them could hardly wait until the
winter was over, and the snow and ice broken up, so as
to let their ships go out to this new land.</p>

<p>This time Thorvald, one of Leif's brothers, led the
expedition. On reaching land, as they stepped ashore,
he exclaimed: "It is a fair region and here I should like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
to make my home." But Thorvald was killed in a
battle with the Indians and was buried where he had
wanted to build his home. The Northmen continued to
visit the new land, but finally the Indians became so
unfriendly that the Northmen went away and never
came again.</p>


<h3>SUGGESTIONS INTENDED TO HELP THE PUPIL</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><strong>The Leading Facts.</strong> <em>1.</em> The Northmen, bold sailors,
settled Iceland and Greenland. <em>2.</em> Leif Ericson reached the
shores of North America and called the country Vinland. <em>3.</em>
The Northmen continued to visit the new land, but finally
ceased to come on account of the Indians.</p>

<p><strong>Study Questions.</strong> <em>1.</em> In what new countries did the Northmen
settle? <em>2.</em> Tell the story of Leif Ericson's voyage. <em>3.</em>
What did he call the new land, and why?</p>

<h3>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, THE FIRST GREAT MAN IN
AMERICAN HISTORY</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Boyhood
of
Columbus</strong></div>


<p><strong>2. Old Trade Routes to Asia.</strong> More than four hundred
fifty years ago Christopher Columbus spent his
boyhood in the queer old Italian town of Genoa on the
shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Even in that far-away
time the Mediterranean was dotted with the white sails
of ships busy in carrying the richest trade in the world.
But no merchants were richer or had bolder sailors than
those of Columbus' own town.</p>

<p>Genoa had her own trading routes to India, China,
and Japan. Her vessels sailed eastward and crossed the
Black Sea to the very shores of Asia. There they found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
stores of rich shawls and silks and of costly spices and
jewels, which had already come on the backs of horses
and camels from the Far East. As fast as winds and
oars could carry them, these merchant ships hastened
back to Genoa, where other ships and sailors were waiting
to carry their goods to all parts of Europe.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Why
Columbus
learned
to like
the sea</strong></div>

<p>Every day the boys of Genoa, as they played along
the wharves, could see the ships from different countries
and could hear the stories of adventure told by the sailors.
No wonder Christopher found it hard to work at his
father's trade of combing wool; he
liked to hear stories of the sea and
to make maps and to study geography
far better than he liked to
comb wool or study arithmetic or
grammar. He was eager to go to
sea and while but a boy he made
his first voyage. He often sailed
with a kinsman, who was an old sea
captain. These trips were full of
danger, not only from storms but
from sea robbers, with whom the
sailors often had hard fights.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Prince
Henry's
work</strong></div>

<p>While Columbus was growing
to be a man, the wise and noble
Prince Henry of Portugal was
sending his sailors to brave the unknown
dangers of the western coast
of Africa to find a new way to India.
The Turks, by capturing Constantinople,
had destroyed Genoa's overland trade routes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Columbus

to Lisbon</strong></div>

<p>The bold deeds of Henry's sailors drew many seamen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
to Lisbon, the capital of Portugal. Columbus went,
too, where he was made welcome by his brother and
other friends. Here he soon earned enough by making
maps to send money home to aid his parents, who were
very poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Sailors
hope to

India</strong></div>

<p>Columbus was now a large, fine-looking young man
with ruddy face and bright eyes, so that he soon won the
heart and the hand of a beautiful lady, the daughter of
one of Prince Henry's old seamen. Columbus was in
the midst of exciting scenes. Lisbon was full of learned
men, and of sailors longing to go on voyages. Year
after year new voyages were made in the hope of reaching
India, but after many trials, the sailors of Portugal had
explored only halfway down the African coast.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Columbus'
new idea</strong></div>

<p>It is said that one day while looking over his father-in-law's
maps, Columbus was startled by the idea of reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
India by sailing directly
west. He thought that this
could be done, because he
believed the world to be
round, although all people,
except the most educated,
then thought the world flat.
Columbus also believed
that the world was much
smaller than it really is.</p>

<p>The best map of that
time located India, China,
and Japan about where
America is. For once, a
mistake in geography
turned out well. Columbus,
believing his route to
be the shortest, spent several
years in gathering proof
that India was directly
west. He went on long voyages
and talked with many
old sailors about the signs
of land to the westward.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A tricky
king</strong></div>

<p>Finally Columbus laid his
plans before the new King
of Portugal, John II. The
king secretly sent out a ship
to test the plan. His sailors,
however, became frightened
and returned before going
very far. Columbus was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
indignant at this mean trick and immediately started
for Spain (1484), taking with him his little son, Diego.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What the
Spaniards
thought
of Columbus</strong></div>


<p><strong>3. Columbus at the Court of Spain.</strong> The King and
Queen of Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella, received him
kindly; but some of their wise men did not believe the world
is round, and declared Columbus foolish for thinking that
countries to the eastward could be reached by sailing to
the westward. He was not discouraged at first, because
other wise men spoke in his favor to the king and queen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Some

<p>It was hard for these rulers to aid him now because
a long and costly war had used up all of Spain's money.
Columbus was very poor and his clothes became threadbare.
Some good people took pity on him and gave
him money but others made sport of the homeless
stranger and insulted him. The very boys in the street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
it is said, knowingly tapped their heads when he went
by to show that they thought him a bit crazy.</p>

<p><strong>4. New Friends
of America.</strong> Disappointed
and discouraged,
after
several years of
weary waiting, Columbus
set out on
foot to try his fortunes
in France. One day while passing along the road,
he came to a convent or monastery. Here he begged a
drink of water and some bread for his tired and hungry
son, Diego, who was then about twelve years of age.
The good prior of the monastery was struck by the fine
face and the noble bearing of the stranger, and began
to talk with him. When Columbus explained his bold
plan of finding a shorter route to India, the prior sent in
haste to the little
port of Palos, near
by, for some old
seamen, among
them a great sailor,
named Pinzón.
These men agreed
with Columbus, for
they had seen
proofs of land to
the westward.</p>

good friend, Queen Isabella, and begged her not to allow
Columbus to go to France, for the honor of such a discovery
ought to belong to Isabella and to Spain. How happy
was the prior when the queen gave him money to pay
the expenses for Columbus to visit her in proper style!
With a heart full of hope, once more Columbus hastened
to the Spanish Court, only to find both king and queen
busy in getting ready for the last great battle of the long
war. Spain won a great victory, and while the people

to make plans for the long-thought-of voyage. But because
the queen refused to make him governor over all
the lands he might
discover, Columbus
mounted his mule
and rode away, once

aid from France.</p>

<p><strong>5. The First Voyage.</strong> Columbus hastened to Palos.
What a sad time in that town when the good queen commanded
her ships and sailors to go with Columbus on
a voyage where the bravest seamen had never sailed!
When all things were ready for the voyage, Columbus'
friend, the good prior, held a solemn religious service,
the sailors said good-by to sorrowing friends, and the
little fleet of three vessels and ninety stout-hearted men
sailed bravely out of the harbor, August 3, 1492.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The stop
at the
Canary
Islands</strong></div>

<p>Columbus commanded the <em>Santa Maria</em>, the largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
vessel, only about ninety feet long. Pinzón was captain
of the <em>Pinta</em>, the fastest vessel, and Pinzón's brother of
the <em>Niña</em>, the smallest vessel. The expedition stopped
at the Canary Islands to make the last preparations for
the long and dangerous voyage. The sailors were in
no hurry to go farther, and many of them broke down
and cried as the western shores of the Canaries faded
slowly from their sight.</p>

<p><em>From a recent reconstruction approved

</div>

<p>After many days, the ships sailed into an ocean filled
with seaweed, and so wide that no sailor could see the
end. Would the ships stick fast or were they about to
run aground on some hidden island and their crews be
left to perish? The little fleet was already in the region
of the trade winds whose gentle but steady breezes were
carrying them farther and farther from home. If these
winds never changed, they thought, how could the ships
ever make their way back?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The sailors

<p>The sailors begged Columbus
to turn back, but
he encouraged them by
pointing out signs of land,
such as flocks of birds,
and green branches floating
in the sea. He told them
that according to the maps
they were near Japan, and
offered a prize to the one
who should first see land.
One day, not long after,
Pinzón shouted, "Land!
Land! I claim my prize." But he had seen only a dark
bank of clouds far away on the horizon. The sailors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
thinking land near, grew cheerful and climbed into the
rigging and kept watch for several days. But no land
came into view and they grew more
downhearted than ever. Because Columbus
would not turn back, they threatened
to throw him into the sea, and
declared that he was a madman leading
them on to certain death.</p>

<p><strong>6. Columbus the Real Discoverer.</strong>
One beautiful evening, after the sailors
sang their vesper hymn, Columbus made
a speech, pointing out how God had
favored them with clear skies and gentle
winds for their voyage, and said that since
they were so near land the ships must
not sail any more after midnight. That very night
Columbus saw, far across the dark waters, the glimmering
light of a torch. A few hours later the <em>Pinta</em> fired a
joyful gun to tell that land had been surely found. All
was excitement on board the ships, and not an eye was
closed that night. Overcome with joy, some of the sailors
threw their arms around Columbus' neck, others kissed
his hands, and those who had opposed him most, fell
upon their knees, begged his pardon, and promised
faithful obedience in the future.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Taking

<p>On Friday morning, October 12, 1492, Columbus,
dressed in a robe of bright red and carrying the royal
flag of Spain, stepped upon the shores of the New World.
Around him were gathered his officers and sailors, dressed
in their best clothes and carrying flags, banners, and
crosses. They fell upon their knees, kissed the earth,
and with tears of joy, gave thanks. Columbus then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
drew his sword and declared that the land belonged to
the King and Queen of Spain.</p>

<p><strong>7. How the People Came to be Called "Indians."</strong>
When the people of this land first saw the ships of Columbus,
they imagined that the Spaniards had come up from
the sea or down from the sky and that they were beings
from Heaven. They, therefore, at first ran frightened
into the woods. Afterwards, as they came back, they fell
upon their knees as if to worship the white men.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Columbus
and
his men
disappointed</strong></div>

<p>Columbus called the island on which he landed San
Salvador and named the people Indians because he
believed he had discovered an island of East India,
although he had really discovered one of the Bahama
Islands, and, as we suppose, the one known to-day as
San Salvador. He and his men were greatly disappointed
at the appearance of these new people, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
instead of seeing them dressed in rich clothes, wearing
ornaments of gold and silver, and living in great cities,
as they had expected, they saw only half-naked, painted
savages living in rude huts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>First

<p><strong>8. Discovery of Cuba.</strong> After a few days Columbus
sailed farther on and found the land now called Cuba,
which he believed was Japan. Here his own ship was
wrecked, leaving him only the <em>Niña</em>, for the <em>Pinta</em> had
gone, he knew not where. He was now greatly alarmed,
for if the <em>Niña</em> should be wrecked he and his men would
be lost and no one would ever hear of his great discovery.
He decided to return to Spain at once, but some
of the sailors were so in love with the beautiful islands
and the kindly people that they resolved to stay and
plant the first Spanish colony in the New World. After
collecting some gold and silver articles, plants, animals,
birds, Indians, and other proofs of his discovery, Columbus
spread the sails of the little <em>Niña</em> for the homeward
voyage, January 4, 1493.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
homeward
voyage</strong></div>


<p><strong>9. Columbus Returns to Spain.</strong> On the way home a
great storm knocked the little vessel about for four days.
All gave up hope, and Columbus wrote two accounts
of his discovery, sealed them in barrels, and set them
adrift. A second storm drove the <em>Niña</em> to Lisbon, in
Portugal, where Columbus told the story of his great
voyage. Some of the Portuguese wished to imprison
Columbus, but the king would not, and in the middle of
March the <em>Niña</em> sailed into the harbor of Palos.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The joy
of Palos</strong></div>

<p>What joy in that little town! The bells were set
ringing and the people ran shouting through the streets
to the wharf, for they had long given up Columbus and
his crew as lost. To add to their joy, that very night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
when the streets were bright with torches, the <em>Pinta</em>,
believed to have been lost, also sailed into the harbor.</p>

<p>Columbus immediately wrote a letter to the king
and queen, who bade him hasten to them in Barcelona.
All along his way, even the villages and the country
roads swarmed with people anxious to see the great discoverer
and to look upon the strange people and the
queer products which he had brought from India, as
they thought.</p>

<p>As he came near the city, a large company of fine
people rode out to give him welcome. He entered the

happy people eager to catch sight of the great hero.</p>

<p>In a great room of the palace, Ferdinand and Isabella
had placed their throne. Into this room marched
Columbus surrounded by
the noblest people of
Spain, but none more noble
looking than the hero.
The king and queen arose
and Columbus fell upon
his knees and kissed their
hands. They gave him a
seat near them and bade
him tell the strange story
of his wonderful voyage.</p>

<p>When he finished, the
king and queen fell upon their knees and raised their
hands in thanksgiving. All the people did the same,
and a great choir filled the room with a song of praise.
The reception was now over and the people, shouting
and cheering, followed Columbus to his home. How like
a dream it must have seemed to Columbus, who only a
year or so before, in threadbare clothes, was begging
bread at the monastery near Palos!</p>

<p><strong>10. The Second Voyage.</strong> But all Spain was on fire
for another expedition. Every seaport was now anxious
to furnish ships, and every bold sailor was eager to go.
In a few months a fleet of seventeen fine ships and fifteen
hundred people sailed away under the command of Columbus
(1493) to search for the rich cities of their dreams.
After four years of exploration and discovery among the
islands that soon after began to be called the West Indies,
Columbus sailed back to Spain greatly disappointed. He
had found no rich cities or mines of gold and silver.</p>

<p><strong>11. The Third and Fourth Voyages.</strong> On his third
voyage (1498) Columbus sailed along the northern shores
of South America, but
when he reached the West
Indies the Spaniards who
had settled there refused
to obey him, seized him,
put him in chains, and
sent him back to Spain.
But the good queen set
Columbus free and sent
him on his fourth voyage
(1502). He explored the
coast of what is now
Central America, but
afterward met shipwreck on the island of Jamaica. He
returned to Spain a broken-hearted man because he had
failed to find the fabled riches of India. He died soon afterward,
not knowing that he had discovered a new world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Naming

country</strong></div>

<p>In 1501 Amerigo Vespucci made a voyage to South
America. He was sent out by Portugal. It was thought
that Vespucci had discovered a different land than that
seen by Columbus. Without intending to wrong Columbus,
the country he saw, and afterward all land to the
northward, was called America.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Honor to
his memory</strong></div>

<p>Spain was too busy exploring the new lands to give
proper heed to the death of the man whose discoveries
would, after a few years, make the kingdom richer even
than India. But it was left to the greatest nation in
all the western world to do full honor to the memory
of Columbus in the World's Columbian Exposition at
Chicago (1892-1893).</p>

<h3>PONCE DE LEON, WHO SOUGHT A MARVELOUS LAND
AND WAS DISAPPOINTED</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>A magic
fountain</strong></div>


<p><strong>12. Ponce de Leon.</strong> When the Spaniards came to
America they were told many strange stories by the
Indians about many marvelous places. Perhaps most
wonderful of all was the story of Bimini, where every
day was perfect and every one was happy. Here was
also the magic fountain which would make old men young
once more, and keep young men from growing old.</p>

<p>When Columbus sailed to America for the second time
he brought with him a brave and able soldier, named
Ponce de Leon. De Leon spent many years on the new
continent fighting for his king against the Indians. After
a while he was made governor of Porto Rico. While
thus serving his country he too heard the story of this
wonderful land which no white man had explored. Like
most Spaniards, he loved adventure. Also he was weary
of the cares of his office, and soon resolved to find this
land and to explore it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>De Leon
sets out
to find
Bimini</strong></div>

<p>In the spring of 1513 De Leon set sail with three ships
from Porto Rico. Somewhere to the north lay this land
of perfect days. Northward he steered for many days,
past lovely tropical islands. At last, on Easter Sunday,
an unknown shore appeared. On its banks were splendid
trees. Flowers bloomed everywhere, and clear streams
came gently down to the sea. De Leon named the new
land Florida and took possession of it for the King of
Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The first
settlement
in
America
founded</strong></div>

<p>Various duties kept him away from the new land for
eight years after its discovery. In 1521 he again set out
from Porto Rico, with priests and soldiers, and amply
provided with cattle and horses and goods. He wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
to the King of Spain: "Now I return to that island, if
it please God's will, to settle it." He was an old man
then and hoped to found a peaceful and prosperous colony
of which he was to be governor. But Indians attacked
his settlement and sickness laid low many of his men.
He had been in Florida only a short time when he himself
was wounded in a fight with the Indians. Feeling that
he would soon die, he hastily set sail with all his men for
Cuba, where he died shortly after.</p>

<p>De Leon had failed to find the wonderful things of
which the Indians had told him. He had failed even to
establish the colony of which he was to be governor. But
De Leon did discover a new and great land which now
forms one of the states of the Union. To him also goes
the honor of having been the first man to make a settlement
in what is now a part of the United States.</p>

<p><strong>13. Cortés Invades Mexico.</strong> Columbus died disappointed
because he had not found the rich cities which
everybody believed were somewhere in India. Foremost
among Spanish soldiers was Hernando Cortés, who, in
1519, sailed with twelve ships from Cuba to the coast
of what is now Mexico. His soldiers and sailors were
hardly on land before he sank every one of his ships.
His men now had to fight. They wore coats of iron, were
armed with swords and guns, and they had a few cannon
and horses. Every few miles they saw villages and now
and then cities. The Indians wore cotton clothes, and
in their ears and around their necks and their ankles
they had gold and silver ornaments. The Spaniards
could hardly keep their hands off these ornaments, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
were so eager for gold. They were now sure that the
rich cities were near at hand, which Columbus had
hoped to find, and which every Spaniard
fully believed would be found.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Difference
in
Spanish
and Indian
ways of
fighting</strong></div>

<p>The people of Mexico had neither
guns nor swords, but they were brave.
Near the first large city, thousands upon
thousands of fiercely painted
warriors wearing leather shields
rushed upon the little band of
Spaniards. For two days the
fighting went on, but not a single
Spaniard was killed. The arrows
of the Indians could not pierce
iron coats, but the sharp Spanish
swords could easily cut leather
shields. The simple natives thought they must be fighting
against gods instead of men, and gave up the battle.</p>

</div>

<p>Day after day Cortés marched on until a beautiful
valley broke upon his view. His men
now saw a wonderful sight: cities
built over lakes, where canals took the
place of streets and
where canoes carried
people from
place to place. It
all seemed like a
dream. But they
hastened forward
to the great capital
city. It, too, was
built over a lake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
larger than any seen before, and it could be reached only
along three great roads of solid mason work.</p>

<p>These roads ran to the center of the
city where stood, in a great square, a
wonderful temple. The top of this
temple could be reached by one hundred
fourteen stone steps running around the
outside. The city contained sixty thousand
people, and there were many stone
buildings, on the flat roofs of which the
natives had beautiful flower gardens.</p>

gave the officers a house near the great

What if the Indians should rise against
him? To guard against this danger,
Cortés compelled Montezuma to live in
the Spanish quarters. The people did not like to see their
beloved ruler a prisoner in his own city.</p>

great fury to drive out the now

filled with angry warriors. Cortés<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
compelled Montezuma to stand upon the roof of the
Spanish fort and command his people to stop fighting.</p>

<p>But he was ruler no
longer. He was struck

and died in a few days,
a broken-hearted man.
After several days of hard

men tried to get out of
the city, but the Indians
fell on the little army and
killed more than half of
the Spanish soldiers before
they could get away.</p>

<p><strong>14. Cortés Conquers
Mexico.</strong> Because of jealousy
a Spanish army was
sent to bring Cortés back
to Cuba. By capturing
this army Cortés secured more soldiers. Once more he
marched against the city. What could bows and arrows
and spears and stones do against the terrible horsemen
and their great swords, or against the Spanish foot
soldiers with their muskets and cannon? At length
the great Indian city was almost destroyed, but thousands
of its brave defenders were killed before the
fighting ceased (1521). From this time on, the country
gradually filled with Spanish settlers.</p>


<p><strong>15. Cortés Visits Spain.</strong> After several years, Cortés
longed to see his native land once more. He set sail,
and reached the little port of Palos from which, many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
years before, the great Columbus had sailed in search
of the rich cities of the Far East. Here, now, was the
very man who had found the splendid cities and had
returned to tell the wonderful story to his king and countrymen.
All along the journey to the king the people
now crowded to see Cortés as they had once crowded
to see Columbus.</p>

The Spanish king permitted great wrong to be

<p><strong>16. Pizarro's Voyages.</strong> Another Spaniard, Francisco
Pizarro, dreamed of finding riches greater than De Leon
or Cortés had ever heard of. He set out for Peru with
an army of two hundred men. Reaching the coast, he
started inland and in a few days came to the foot of the
Andes. They crossed the mountains and, marching
down the eastern side, the Spaniards came upon the
Inca, the native ruler, and his army. By trickery they
made the Inca a prisoner, put him to death, and then
subdued the army. The Spaniards then marched on to
Cuzco, the capital
of Peru,
where they
found enormous
quantities
of gold and
silver. Never
before in the
history of the
world had so
many riches
been found.
This great
wealth was divided
among
the Spaniards
according to
rank. But the
greedy Spaniards
fell to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
quarreling and fighting among themselves, and Pizarro
fell by the hand of one of his own men.</p>

<h3>CORONADO, WHO PENETRATED SOUTHWESTERN UNITED
STATES BUT FOUND NOTHING BUT BEAUTIFUL SCENERY</h3>


<p><strong>17. Coronado's Search for Rich Cities.</strong> Stories of
rich cities to the north of Mexico led Francisco Coronado
with a thousand men into the rocky regions now known
as New Mexico and Arizona. They looked with wonder
at the Grand Cañon of the Colorado, but they found no
wealthy cities or temples ornamented with gold and silver.</p>

<p>They pushed farther north into what is now Kansas
and Nebraska, into the great western prairies with their
vast seas of waving grass and herds of countless buffalo.
"Crooked-back oxen" the Spaniards named the buffalo.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Coronado

gold or

<p>But Coronado was after gold and silver, and cared
nothing for beautiful and interesting scenes. Disappointed,
he turned southward and in 1542, after three
years of wandering, reached home in Mexico. He
reported to the King of Spain that the region he had
explored was too poor a place for him to plant colonies.</p>

<h3>DE SOTO, THE DISCOVERER OF THE MISSISSIPPI</h3>


<p><strong>18. The Expedition to Florida.</strong> While Coronado and
his men were searching in vain for hidden cities with
golden temples, another band of men was wandering
through the forests farther to the eastward. Hernando
de Soto had been one of Pizarro's bravest soldiers. The
news that this bold adventurer was to lead an expedition
to Florida stirred all Spain. Many nobles sold their
lands to fit out their sons to fight under so great a leader.</p>

</div>

<p>The Spanish settlers of Cuba gave a joyful welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to De Soto and to the brave men from the homeland.
After many festivals and solemn religious ceremonies,
nine vessels, carrying many
soldiers, twelve priests, six
hundred horses, and a herd
of swine, sailed for Florida
(1539).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
settlers
of Cuba

De Soto</strong></div>

<p>What a grand sight to the
Indians as the men and
horses clad in steel armor
landed! There were richly
colored banners, beautiful
crucifixes, and many things
never before seen by the
Indians. But this was by
far the most cruel expedition
yet planned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Spaniards'
cruelty
to the
Indians</strong></div>

<p>Wherever the Spaniards
marched Indians were seized as slaves and made to carry
the baggage and do the hard work. If the Indian guides
were false, they were burned at the stake or were torn to
pieces by bloodhounds. Hence the Indians feared the
Spaniards, and Indian guides often misled the Spanish soldiers
on purpose to save the guides' own tribes from harm.</p>

<p>De Soto fought his way through forests and swamps
to the head of Apalachee Bay, where he spent the winter.
In the spring a guide led the army into what is now
Georgia, in search of a country supposed to be rich in
gold and ruled by a woman. The soldiers suffered and
grumbled, but De Soto only turned the march farther
northward.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Attacked
by
Indians</strong></div>

<p>The Appalachian Mountains caused them to turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
south again until they reached the village of Mavilla
(Mobile), where the Indians rushed on them in great
numbers and tried to crush the army. But Spanish
swords and Spanish guns won the day against Indian
arrows and Indian clubs. De Soto lost a number of
men, at least a dozen horses, and the baggage of his
entire army, yet he boldly refused to send to the coast
for the men and supplies waiting for him there.</p>


<p><strong>19. The Discovery of the Mississippi.</strong> Again De
Soto's men followed him northward, this time into what
we know as northern Mississippi, where the adventuring
army spent the second winter in a deserted Indian village.
In the spring, in 1541, De Soto demanded two
hundred Indians to carry baggage, but the chief and his
men one night stole into camp, set fire to their own rude
houses, gave the war whoop, frightened many horses into
running away, and killed a number of the Spaniards.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>They

<p>The army then marched westward for many days,
wading swamps and wandering through forests so dense
that at times they
could not see the

river was reached
greater than any
the Spaniards had
ever seen. It was
the Mississippi,
more than a mile
wide, rushing on at
full flood toward
the Gulf.</p>

<p>On barges made
by their own hands, De Soto and his men crossed to the
west bank of the broad stream. There they marched
northward, probably as far as the region now known as
Missouri, and then westward two hundred miles. Nothing
but hardships met them on every hand. In the spring
of 1542, the little army came upon the Mississippi again.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Burial of
De Soto</strong></div>

<p>De Soto was tiring out. He grew sad and asked the
Indians how far it was to the sea. But it was too far
for the bold leader. A fever seized him, and after a few
days he died. At dead of night his companions buried
him in the bosom of the great river he had discovered.</p>


<p><strong>20. Only Half the Army Returns to Cuba.</strong> There
were bold leaders still left in the army. They turned
westward again, but after finding neither gold nor silver,
they returned to the Mississippi and spent the winter
on its banks. There they built boats, and then floated
down to the Gulf. Only one half of the army returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to tell the sad tales of hardships, battles, and poverty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What

<p>Thus it came about that Coronado and De Soto proved
that northward from Mexico there were no rich cities,
such as Columbus had dreamed about, and such as Cortés
and Pizarro had really found. Hence it was that the
King of Spain and his brave adventurers took less interest
in that part of North America which is now the United
States, and more in Mexico and in South America.</p>

</div>


<p><strong>21. Magellan's Task.</strong> Columbus died believing that
he had discovered a part of India. But he had not
proved that the earth is round by sailing around it. This
great task was left for Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese
sailor. Columbus' great voyage had stirred up the Portuguese.
One of their boldest sailors, Vasco da Gama,
had reached India in
1498 by rounding Africa,
and Magellan
had made voyages for
seven years among the
islands of the East.</p>

Pacific, meaning peaceful</em></p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Magellan,
too,
goes to
Spain</strong></div>

<p>After returning to
Portugal, Magellan
sought the king's aid,
but without success;
then, like Columbus,
he went to Spain, and
in less than two years
his fleet of five vessels
sailed for the coast of
South America (1519).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Severe storms tossed the vessels about for nearly a month.
Food and water grew scarce. The sailors threatened to
kill Magellan, but
the brave captain,
like Columbus,
kept boldly on until
he reached cold
and stormy Patagonia.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>His
sailors
rebel</strong></div>

<p>It was Easter
time, and the long,
hard winter was
already setting in.
Finding a safe harbor
and plenty of
fish, Magellan decided
to winter
there. But the
captains of three ships refused to obey, and decided to
kill Magellan and lead the fleet back to Spain. Magellan
was too quick for them. He captured one of the ships,
turned the cannon on the others, and soon forced them
to surrender.</p>

<p>There were no more outbreaks that winter. One of
the ships was wrecked. How glad the sailors were when,
late in August, they saw the first signs of spring! But
they were not so happy when Magellan commanded
the ships to sail still farther south in search of a passage
to the westward.</p>

<p>In October, his little fleet entered a wide, deep channel
and found rugged, snow-clad mountains rising high on
both sides of them. Many of the sailors believed they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
had at last found the westward passage, and that it was
now time to turn homeward.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Magellan's
bold
resolution</strong></div>

<p>But Magellan declared that he would "eat the leather
off the ship's yards" rather than turn back. The sailors
on one ship seized and bound the captain and sailed back
to Spain. Magellan with but three ships sailed bravely
on until a broad, quiet ocean broke upon his sight. He
wept for joy, for he believed that now the western route
to India had indeed been found. This new ocean, so
calm, so smooth and peaceful, he named the Pacific, and
all the world now calls the channel he discovered the
Strait of Magellan.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The first
voyage
across
the
Pacific
begins</strong></div>

<p>No man had yet sailed across the Pacific, and no man
knew the distance. Magellan was as bold a sailor as
ever sailed the main, and he had brave men with him.
In November (1520) the three little ships boldly turned
their prows toward India. On and on they sailed.
Many of the crew, as they looked out upon a little island,
saw land for the last time. Many thousand miles had
yet to be sailed before land would again be seen. After
long weeks their food supply gave out and starvation
stared them in the face. Many grew sick and died. The
others had to eat leather taken from the ship's yards like
so many hungry beasts.</p>

<p>How big the world seemed to these poor, starving
sailors! But the captain never lost courage. Finally
they beheld land. It was the group of islands now known
as the Marianas (Ladrones). Here the sailors rested
and feasted to their hearts' content.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Visits
the

<p>Then Magellan pressed on to another group of islands
which were afterwards called the Philippines, from King
Philip of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Magellan

<p>Here in a battle with the inhabitants, while bravely
defending his sailors, Magellan was killed. Their great
commander was gone and they were still far from Spain.
Sadly his sailors continued the voyage, but only one of the
vessels, with about twenty men, ever reached home to tell
the story of that wonderful first voyage around the world.</p>

<h3>SUGGESTIONS INTENDED TO HELP THE PUPIL</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><strong>The Leading Facts.</strong> <em>1.</em> Columbus was born near the shores
of the Mediterranean and trained for the sea by study and by
experience. <em>2.</em> The people of Europe traded with the Far
East, but the Turks destroyed their trade routes. <em>3.</em> Columbus
was drawn to Portugal because of Prince Henry's great
work. <em>4.</em> Columbus thought he could reach the rich cities of
the East by sailing west. <em>5.</em> After many discouragements
he won aid from Isabella and discovered the Bahama Islands,
Cuba, and Haiti. <em>6.</em> The king and queen of Spain received
Columbus with great ceremony. <em>7.</em> Columbus made three
more voyages, but was disappointed in not finding the rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
cities of India. <em>8.</em> Ponce de Leon sailed from Porto Rico to
find a land of which strange stories had been told of riches
and of a fountain of eternal youth. <em>9.</em> He reached Florida
on Easter Sunday, 1513. <em>10.</em> Eight years later he returned
to found a settlement. <em>11.</em> He was attacked by the Indians,
wounded, and forced to return to Porto Rico, where he died of
his wounds. <em>12.</em> His is the distinction of being the first
white man to plant a settlement in the United States after the
discovery of America by Columbus. <em>13.</em> Cortés marched
against a rich city, afterward called Mexico, captured the ruler,
and fought great battles with the people. <em>14.</em> Cortés captured
the city and ruled it for several years. <em>15.</em> From this time
on Mexico gradually filled with Spanish settlers. <em>16.</em> Pizarro
invaded Peru, the richest of all countries, and captured and put
to death the ruler. <em>17.</em> Pizarro was killed by his own men.
<em>18.</em> Coronado marched north from Mexico into Arizona
and New Mexico, but found no rich cities. <em>19.</em> He wandered
into the great prairies and the rocky country of Colorado but
finally turned back in disappointment. <em>20.</em> De Soto wandered
over the country east of the Rocky Mountains in search
of rich cities, but found a great river, the Mississippi, and later
was buried in its waters. <em>21.</em> Hence the Spaniards, eager for
gold, went to Mexico and South America rather than farther
to the north. <em>22.</em> Columbus thought the world was round,
but Magellan proved it. <em>23.</em> Magellan sailed around South
America into the Pacific Ocean, and across this new sea to
the Philippine Islands, where he was killed. <em>24.</em> His ship
reached Spain&mdash;the first to sail around the world.</p>

<p><strong>22. Cabot's Voyages.</strong> When the news of Columbus'
great discovery reached England, the king was sorry,
no doubt, that he had not helped him. The story is
that Columbus had gone to Henry VII, King of England,
for aid to make his voyage. But England had a brave
sailor of her own,
John Cabot, an
Italian, born in
Columbus' own
town of Genoa,
who also had
learned his lessons
in voyages
on the Mediterranean.
Cabot
had gone to live
in the old town
of Venice. Afterward
he made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
England his home and lived in the old seaport town
of Bristol, the home of many English sailors.</p>

<p>He, too, believed the
world to be round, and that
India could be reached by
sailing westward. King Henry
VII gave Cabot permission to
try, providing he would give
the king one fifth of all the gold
and silver which everybody believed
he would find in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What
John
Cabot
discovered</strong></div>

<p>Accordingly, John Cabot,
and it may be his son, Sebastian,
set out on a voyage in
May, 1497. After many weeks,
Cabot discovered land, now
supposed to be either a part of
Labrador or of Cape Breton
Island. He landed and planted
the flag of England, and by its
side set up that of Venice, which had been his early home.</p>

<p>Later, he probably saw parts of Newfoundland, but
nowhere did he see a single inhabitant. He did, however,
find signs that the country was inhabited, but he found no
proof of rich cities or of gold and silver. In the seas all
around Cabot saw such vast swarms of fish that he told
the people of England they would not need to go any
more to cold and snowy Iceland to catch fish.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

at home. "The king has promised that in the spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>

honor is paid to him; he dresses in silk, and the English run
after him like mad people, so that he can enlist as many
of them as he pleases, and a number of our own rogues
besides. The discoverer of these places planted on his new-found
land a large cross, with one flag of England and
another of St. Mark, by reason of his being a Venetian."</p>

<p>Again, in May, 1498, John Cabot started for India
by sailing toward the northwest. This time the fleet
was larger, and filled with eager English sailors. But
Cabot could not find a way to India, so he altered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
course and coasted southward as far as the region now
called North Carolina.</p>

<p>Now because of these two voyages of Cabot, England
later claimed a large part of North America, for he had
really seen the mainland of America before Columbus.
Spain also claimed the same region, but we have seen
how Mexico and Peru drew Spaniards to those countries.</p>

<p>If England had been quick to act and had made settlements
where Cabot explored, she would have had little
trouble in getting a hold in North America. But she
did not do so. Henry VII was old and stingy. Cabot
had twice failed to find India with its treasures of gold
and silver, so little attention was given to the new lands.</p>

<h3>SIR FRANCIS DRAKE, THE ENGLISH "DRAGON," WHO SAILED
THE SPANISH MAIN AND WHO "SINGED THE KING
OF SPAIN'S BEARD"</h3>


<p><strong>23. The Quarrel between Spain and England.</strong> After
John Cabot failed to find a new way to India, King Henry
did nothing more to help English discovery. His son,
Henry VIII, got into a great quarrel with the King of
Spain. He was too busy with this quarrel to think much
about America. But during this very time, Cortés and
Pizarro were doing their wonderful deeds. Spain grew
bold, seized English seamen, threw them into dungeons,
and even burned them at the stake. Englishmen robbed
Spanish ships and killed Spanish sailors in revenge.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Their

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Why
Drake
hated the
Spaniards</strong></div>


<p><strong>24. Sir Francis Drake.</strong> A most daring English seaman
was Sir Francis Drake. From boyhood days he
had been a sailor. His cousin, Captain Hawkins, gave
him command of a ship against Mexico, but the Spaniards
fell upon it, killed many of the sailors, and took all they
had. Drake came back ruined, and eager to take revenge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Besides, he hated the Spaniards because he thought they
were plotting to kill Elizabeth, the Queen of England.</p>

<p>In 1573 Drake returned to England with his ship loaded
with gold and precious stones, captured from the Spaniards
on the Isthmus of Panama.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Begins
his most
famous
voyage</strong></div>


<p><strong>25. Drake's Voyage around the World.</strong> After four
years Drake, with four small but fast vessels, sailed
direct for the Strait of Magellan. He was determined
to sail the Pacific, which he had seen while on the Isthmus
of Panama. In June his fleet entered the harbor of
Patagonia where Magellan had spent the winter more
than fifty years before.</p>

<p><em>From the original portrait attributed to
Sir Antonis van Moor, in the possession
of Viscount Dillon, at
Ditchly Park, England</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>After destroying his smallest vessel, which was leaky,
Drake sailed to the entrance of the Strait. Here he
changed the name of his ship from the <em>Pelican</em> to the <em>Golden
Hind</em>, with ceremonies fitting
the occasion.</p>

<p>The fleet passed safely
through the Strait, but as it
sailed out into the Pacific a terrible
storm scattered the ships.
One went down, and one returned
to England, believing
that Drake's ship, the <em>Golden
Hind</em>, had been destroyed.</p>

<p>But Drake had a bold heart,
good sailors, and a stout ship.
After the storm he sailed
north to Valparaiso, where
his men saw the first great
treasure ship. The Spanish
sailors jumped overboard, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
left four hundred pounds of gold to Drake and his men.
Week after week Drake sailed northward until he reached
Peru, the land conquered by Pizarro.</p>

<p>Another great treasure ship had just
sailed for Panama. Away sped the
<em>Golden Hind</em> in swift pursuit. For a
thousand miles, day and night, the
chase went on. One evening, just at
dark, the little ship rushed upon the
great vessel, and captured her. What
a rich haul! More than twenty tons
of silver bars, thirteen chests of silver
coin, one hundredweight of gold, besides
a great store of precious stones.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

<p>The little ship continued northward. Hoping for a
northeast passage to the Atlantic, Drake sailed along the
coast as far as what was afterward known as the Oregon
country. But the increasing cold and fog and the strong
northwest winds made him turn southward again. Sailing
close inshore, he found a small harbor, just north of
the great bay of San Francisco. Here his stout little ship
came to anchor. The natives believed that Drake and
his men were gods, and begged them to remain with them
always. Drake named the country New Albion and took
possession in the name of the queen, Elizabeth. When
he had refitted his ship for the long voyage home, Drake
set sail, to the great sorrow of the natives.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Drake

<p>Week after week went by, until he saw the very islands

the islands and across the Indian Ocean until the Cape
of Good Hope was rounded, and the <em>Golden Hind</em> spread
her sails northward toward England.</p>

up as lost, shouted for joy when they heard he was safe.
Queen Elizabeth visited his ship in person, and there gave
him a title, so that now he was Sir Francis Drake. Years
after, a chair was made from the timbers of the famous

it can now be seen.</p>

Spaniards (1585). He sailed boldly for the coast of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Spain, frightened the people, and then went in search
of the Gold Fleet, which was bringing shipload after

<p>No sooner had Drake missed the fleet than he made
direct for the West Indies, where he spread terror among
the islands. The Spaniards had heard of Drake, the
"Dragon." He attacked and destroyed three important
towns, and intended to seize Panama itself, but the yellow
fever began to cut down his men, so he sailed to Roanoke
Island, and carried back to England the starving and
homesick colony which Raleigh had planted there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Singeing

<p>The Spanish king was angry. He resolved to crush
England. More than one hundred ships, manned by
thousands of sailors, were to carry a great army to the
hated island. Drake heard about it, and quickly gathered
thirty fast ships manned by sailors as bold as himself.
His fleet sailed right into the harbor of Cadiz, past
cannon and forts, and burned so many Spanish ships
that it took Spain another year to get the great fleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
ready. Drake declared that he had "singed the King
of Spain's beard."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Spain

<p><strong>27. The Spanish Armada.</strong> The King of Spain was
bound to crush England at one mighty blow. In 1588
the Spanish Armada, as the great fleet was called, sailed
for England. There were scores of war vessels manned
by more than seven thousand sailors, carrying nearly
twenty thousand soldiers. Almost every noble family in
Spain sent one or more of its sons to fight against England.</p>

<p>When this mighty fleet reached the English Channel,
Drake and other sea captains as daring as himself dashed
at the Spanish ships, and by the help of a great storm
that came up, succeeded in destroying almost the whole
fleet. No such blow had ever before fallen upon the great
and powerful Spanish nation.</p>

<p>From that time on her power grew less and less, while
England's power on the sea grew greater and greater.
Englishmen could now go to America without much
thought of danger from Spaniards.</p>

<h3>SIR WALTER RALEIGH, THE FRIEND OF ELIZABETH, PLANTS
A COLONY IN AMERICA TO CHECK THE POWER OF SPAIN</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Raleigh,
student,
soldier,
seaman</strong></div>


<p><strong>28. Sir Walter Raleigh.</strong> Born (1552) near the sea,
Raleigh fed his young imagination with stories of the wild
doings of English seamen. He went to college at Oxford
at the age of fourteen, and made a good name as a student.</p>

<p>In a few years young Raleigh went to France to take
part in the religious wars of that unhappy country.
At the time he returned home all England was rejoicing
over Drake's first shipload of gold. When Queen Elizabeth
sent an army to aid the people of Holland against
the Spaniards, young Raleigh was only too glad to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE BOYHOOD OF RALEIGH</p>

<p><em>After the painting by Sir John E. Millais</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>On his return from this war he went with his half-brother,
Sir Humphrey Gilbert, on two voyages to
America, at the
very same time
Drake was plundering
the Spanish
treasure ships in
the Pacific Ocean.
Afterward Raleigh
turned soldier
again and, as captain,
went to Ireland,
where Spain
had sent soldiers to
stir up rebellion. Thus, before he was thirty years old,
he had been a seaman and a soldier, and had been in
France, Holland, America, and Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Raleigh
when
thirty
years old</strong></div>

<p>At this time Raleigh was a fine-looking man, about
six feet tall, with dark hair and a handsome face. He
had plenty of wit and good sense, although he was fond,
indeed, of fine clothes. He was just the very one to
catch the favor of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>One day Elizabeth and her train of lords and ladies
were going down the roadway from the royal castle to
the river. The people crowded both sides of the road
to see their beloved queen and her beautiful ladies go
by. Raleigh pressed his way to the front.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>How he
won the
favor of
the queen</strong></div>

<p>As Elizabeth drew near, she hesitated about passing
over a muddy place. In a moment the feeling that
every true gentleman has in the presence of ladies told
Raleigh what to do, and the queen suddenly saw his
beautiful red velvet cloak lying in the mud at her feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
She stepped upon it, nodded to its gallant owner, and
passed on. From this time forward Raleigh was a great
favorite at the court of Queen
Elizabeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Raleigh's
plan for
checking
the power
of Spain</strong></div>


<p><strong>29. Trying to Plant English
Colonies.</strong> In 1584 Raleigh
caused a friend to write
a letter to the queen, explaining
that English colonies
planted on the coast of North
America would not only
check the power of Spain but
would also increase the power
of England. That very year
the queen gave him permission
to plant colonies. Thus a better
way of opposing Spain was
found than by robbing treasure
ships and burning towns.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Indians

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Why the
land was
named
Virginia</strong></div>

<p>Raleigh immediately sent a ship to explore. The
captain landed on what is now Roanoke Island. The
Indians came with a fleet of forty canoes to give them a
friendly welcome. After a few days an Indian queen
with her maidens came to entertain the English. "We
found the people most gentle, loving, and faithful, void
of all guile and treason," said Captain Barlow. His
glowing account of the land and people so pleased Elizabeth
that she named the country Virginia, in honor of
her own virgin life.</p>

<p>Raleigh next sent out a kinsman, Sir Richard Grenville,
with a fleet of seven vessels and one hundred settlers,
under Ralph Lane as governor. But the settlers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
were bent on finding gold and silver, instead of making
friends with the Indians.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Why the
Indians
became
hostile</strong></div>

<p>An Indian stole a silver cup from the English. Because
of this theft Lane and his men fell upon the Indian village,
drove out men, women, and children, burned their
homes, and destroyed their crops. This was not only
cruel but also foolish, for the story of his cruelty spread
to other tribes, and after that wherever the English
went they were always in danger from the Indians.</p>

<p>When Drake came along the
next spring with his great fleet,
the settlers were only too glad
to get back to England, and be
once more among friends. They
took home from America the
turkey and two food plants, the
white potato and Indian corn&mdash;worth
more to the world than
all the gold and silver found in
the mines of Mexico and Peru!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Raleigh
tries
again</strong></div>

<p>Although Raleigh had already
spent thousands of dollars, he
would not give up. He immediately
sent out a second colony
of one hundred fifty settlers, a
number of whom were women.
John White was governor. Roanoke
was occupied once more,
and there, shortly afterwards,
was born Virginia Dare, the first
white child of English parents in North America. Before a
year went by, the governor had to go to England for aid.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A WILD TURKEY</p></div>
</div>

<p>But Raleigh and all England had little time to think
of America. The Armada was coming, and every English
ship and sailor was needed to
fight the Spaniards. Two years
went by before Governor White
reached America with supplies.
When he did reach there practically
no trace of the colony could
be found. Not a settler was left
to tell the tale.</p>

<p>The only trace of Raleigh's "lost
colony" was the word "Croatoan"
cut in large letters on a post. Croatoan was the name
of an island near by. White returned home, but
Raleigh sent out an old seaman, Samuel Mace, to search
for the lost colony. It was all in vain. Many years
later news reached England that a tribe of Indians had
a band of white slaves, but
the mystery of the lost colony
never was cleared up.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Raleigh's

<p>Raleigh had now spent his
great fortune. But he did not
lose heart, for he said that he
would live to see Virginia a
nation. He was right. Before
he died a great colony had
been planted in Virginia, and
a ship loaded with the products
of Virginia had sailed
into London port and an
Indian "princess" had married a Virginian and had been
received with honor by the King and Queen of England.</p>

<p><strong>30. The Death of Raleigh.</strong> But the great Elizabeth
was dead, and an unfriendly king, James I, was on the
throne. He threw Raleigh
into prison, and kept him
there thirteen years. The
Spaniards urged the king
to put Raleigh to death.
He had been a life-long
enemy of Spain and they
knew they were not safe if
he lived.</p>

the St. Lawrence. He gave
them presents and bought
their skins of beaver and of other animals. In the fur
trade he saw a golden stream flowing into the king's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>

<p><strong>32. Champlain
and
the Indians.</strong>
The Algonquins
were bitter
foes of the
Iroquois or
Five Nations.
One time they
begged Champlain
and his
men, clad in steel and armed with the deadly musket, to
join their war party (1609). This he did. They made
their way up the St. Lawrence to the mouth of the
Richelieu, and up that river to the falls. The Indians
then carried the canoes and the baggage around the falls.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Discovery
of
Lake
Champlain</strong></div>

<p>What must have been Champlain's feelings when they
glided out of the narrow river into the lake now bearing
his name! A lake no white man had ever seen, and
greater than any in his beloved France! On the left
he saw the ridges of the Green Mountains, on the right
the pine-clad slopes of the Adirondacks, the hunting
grounds of the hated Iroquois.</p>

<p>One evening, near where the ruins of Ticonderoga now
stand, they saw the war canoes of their enemies. That
night the hostile tribes taunted each other and boasted
of their bravery. On the shores of the lake the next day
they drew up in battle array. The Iroquois chiefs wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
tall plumes on their heads, and their warriors carried
shields of wood or hide.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Why the
Iroquois
came to
hate the
French</strong></div>

<p>All at once the Algonquins opened their ranks and
Champlain, in full armor, walked forth. The Iroquois
gazed in wonder on the first European soldier they had
ever seen. Champlain leveled his musket and fired. Two
chiefs fell. Then another report rang through the woods,
and the boldest warriors in North America broke and fled
in confusion. The Algonquins, yelling like demons, ran
after them, killing and capturing as many as possible.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing among the victors, and Champlain
was their hero. But there must have been great
sorrow and vows of revenge among the Iroquois.</p>

<p>The next year Champlain joined another Algonquin
war party, and helped win another victory from the
Iroquois. Again, in 1615, he joined a party of more than
five hundred fiercely painted warriors. They traveled
to the shore of Lake Ontario and boldly crossed to the
other side in their bark canoes. They hid their boats and
then silently marched into the country of the Iroquois.</p>

<p><strong>33. French Explorers in the Northwest.</strong> Year after
year, traders and missionaries, returning to Montreal
and Quebec from the west, told strange stories of a great
river larger than any the French had yet seen. In May,
1673, Joliet, a fur trader, and Marquette, a missionary,
were sent out by Count Frontenac, governor of the French
settlements in Canada, to explore this river.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Joliet

<p>With five others they paddled in canoes along the north
shore of Lake Michigan, through Green Bay, up the Fox
River, and then crossed overland to the beautiful Wisconsin.
Quietly and rapidly their boats passed down the
Wisconsin until they reached a great valley several miles
in width and a great river.</p>

<p>Following the current, they passed the mouth of the
gently flowing Illinois, then the rushing and muddy Missouri,
the slow and clear Ohio, and finally, in July, they
reached the mouth of the Arkansas. Convinced that
the Mississippi flowed into the Gulf of Mexico, they set
out on the return trip of two thousand miles.</p>

<p>Joliet reached Quebec in safety, but Marquette fell ill
and remained among the Indians. The next spring while
preaching in Illinois near where Ottawa now stands, he
fell ill again, and died. The Indians showed their love
and respect by bearing his remains by canoe to Mackinac,
where he was buried beneath the chapel floor of his own
mission house.</p>

<h3>HENRY HUDSON, WHOSE DISCOVERIES LED DUTCH TRADERS
TO COLONIZE NEW NETHERLAND</h3>


<p><strong>34. Hudson's Explorations.</strong> One year after the men
of New France had founded the city of Quebec the Dutch
began the colony which became the Empire State. About
the time John Smith was working hard for Jamestown, his
friend Henry Hudson was sailing for some Dutch merchants
in search of a northern sea route to India (1609).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
discovery
of
the

by the

<p>One bright fall day Hudson sailed into the mouth of
the great river which now bears his name. He hoped
that he had entered the arm of the sea which might carry
him to India. He turned the prow of his vessel, the
<em>Half Moon</em>, up stream.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What
Hudson
and his
men saw</strong></div>

<p>Soon the beauty of the river, the rich colors of the great
forests, the steep sides of the palisades, the slopes of the
highlands, the strange Indians
in their bark canoes, so
took the attention of Hudson
and his crew that, for a time,
they forgot all about a route
to India.</p>

<p>What a flutter of excitement
the <em>Half Moon</em> must
have caused among the Indians!
They came on board
to give welcome and presents
to Hudson and his men.</p>

<p>On the return, probably
near the present city of Hudson,
an old chief came on board and invited Hudson to
visit the little village of wigwams located on the river.
There these Dutchmen saw beautiful meadows, fields of
corn, and gardens of pumpkins, grapes, and plums.</p>

<p>The chief showed Hudson his palace of bark, and spread
a feast of roasted pigeons and other Indian food before
him. In spite of such kind treatment, Hudson would
not stay over night with the Indians, who even broke
their bows and arrows and then threw them into the fire
to prove that they meant no harm to the white man, but
Hudson and his men were still afraid.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Indians
kind but
Hudson
cruel</strong></div>

<p>Indeed, Hudson had every reason to fear the Indians,
for he had treated them badly and his men had even
murdered some. In less than a month, Indian friendship
had been turned into Indian hatred.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>INDIANS WELCOMING THE "HALF MOON," HUDSON'S SHIP</p></div>
</div>

<p>The next year Hudson sailed in an English vessel in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
search of the long-wished-for passage. On he went, far
to the northward, past Iceland and Greenland, into the
great bay which
bears his name.
In this desolate
region, surrounded
by fields of ice
and snow, Hudson
and his men
spent a fearful
winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Fate of

<p>In the spring
his angry sailors
threw him and a few faithful friends into a boat and sent
them adrift. Nothing more was ever heard of them. In
Irving's "Rip Van Winkle" the story tells of nightly
scenes in the Catskills in which the ghosts of Hudson and
his friends were the actors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A trading

<p><strong>35. Dutch Traders and the Indians.</strong> Just as soon
as the news of Hudson's first voyage reached Holland,
the Dutch merchants claimed all the region explored
by Hudson and his men and hastened to open up trade
with the Indians. As early as 1614 a trading post was
established on Manhattan Island&mdash;the beginning of a
great city, New York.</p>

<p>Other posts were soon located: one up the Hudson
became Fort Orange, another on the Delaware was named
Fort Nassau, and a fourth was placed where Jersey City
now stands. Later the Dutch traders went as far east
as the Connecticut Valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A lasting
Indian
treaty</strong></div>

<p>The Dutchmen treated the Indians kindly and early
made a great treaty with the Iroquois, or Five Nations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
The chiefs of many tribes came to Fort Orange dressed
for the event. Their bows and arrows and tomahawks
were decorated, their garments tasseled and fringed, and
on their heads they wore nodding plumes of many sorts,
while their faces were hideous with paint. A peace belt
of deer skin covered with beads was held at one end by
the chiefs and at the other by the Dutch traders. They
"smoked the pipe of peace, buried the tomahawk," and
made vows of everlasting friendship.</p>

<p>The Indians liked the Dutch, who often visited them in
their wigwams and sat around their camp fires. The fur
trade grew rapidly. The Indians hunted and trapped as
never before. They paddled up the Hudson, and crossed
over to lakes George and Champlain. They went up the
Mohawk far beyond where Schenectady now is, plunged
deeper into the unbroken forests, and even climbed the
mountains in search of fur-coated animals. The favorite
fur-bearing animal
was the beaver.
Besides, the
otter, mink, and
weasel were
hunted.</p>

<p>When the fur
pack was made up
the dusky hunters
from every direction
made their
way to the nearest
trading post.
There they traded their furs for guns, powder, and ball,
and for whatever else the white trader had that pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Indian fancy. Great Dutch ships came every year to
carry to Amsterdam and other Dutch cities rich cargoes
of furs.</p>

Already a
great company of
Amsterdam merchants
were sending
settlers, as well
as fur traders, to
the new colony,
which now was
called New Netherland. Peter Minuit, the first governor,
bought the island of Manhattan from the Indians
for twenty-four dollars' worth of glass beads and other
trinkets, built a town of log cabins on the end of the
island, and named it New Amsterdam.</p>

<p>But settlers did not come rapidly enough, so the company
offered its members large tracts of land and the
title of "patroon"
or "patron," on
the condition that
they plant colonies
at their own
expense. Each
patroon was to
govern the people
on his own land.</p>

whose plantation in the region of Fort Orange included
one thousand square miles. The farmers and servants on
these plantations
looked upon the
patroon as being
much above them
in authority and
social position.</p>

<p>Every year the
farmers and their
families came
with their wagons
filled with what they had raised to pay the patroon for
the use of the land. He set them a great feast, and
there was merrymaking all day long.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A wicked

<p>The growth of New Netherland attracted bad men as

a number of Indians not of the Five Nations.
The Indians robbed and murdered in return. War broke
out, and before it ended many settlements were broken
up, and hundreds of settlers killed.</p>

<p>Parties of Indians roved day and night over Manhattan
Island, killing the Dutch even in sight of Fort Amsterdam.
The people blamed their governor, Kieft, and
threatened to arrest him and send him to Holland. He
finally made peace with the Indians just before the new
governor arrived.</p>

<p>In the spring, when Virginia
is in her gayest dress, the ships
sailed up Chesapeake Bay into
the James River, and landed on
a peninsula. Here they began
to plant Jamestown, named in
honor of their king, the first permanent
English settlement in the
New World.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Settlers

<p>They first built a fort to protect
them from any attacks of
Indians and Spaniards. But
most of the settlers wanted to
get rich quick, go back to England,
and spend the rest of their
days in ease. Therefore, instead of building comfortable
houses and raising something to eat, they spent their time
in searching for gold.</p>

<p>The result was that most of them fell sick and food grew
scarce. Within a few months more than half of the settlers
were dead, and the others were discouraged and homesick.
Would this colony fail, too, as Raleigh's colony had?</p>


<p><strong>38. John Smith.</strong> There was one man, however, in
the colony who could make Jamestown a success. He
bore the plain name of John Smith. But he was no
common man. John Smith had already had as wonderful
adventures as the knights of old.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>John

<p>While yet a young man he went to the land of dikes

fighting one another, and resolved to go and fight the
Turks. On his way he was robbed in France and left
half dead in a great forest, but was rescued and made his
way to the sea. Then he sailed with a colony of pilgrims
going to the Holy Land. After many adventures John
Smith found himself in eastern Europe. He was made
captain of a troop of cavalry and was soon fighting the
Turks. In three hand-to-hand combats, Captain Smith
slew his enemies, cut off their heads, and presented them
to his commander.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Smith

<p>The Christian army looked on Smith as a hero, and the

captured Smith and made a slave of him. His
master's cruelty was so great that Smith slew him,
mounted his horse, and rode away to Russia. He finally
returned to England in time to talk with Captain Newport

An Indian took it and returned with the articles asked for
in the letter. This
was still more mysterious
than the
compass.</p>

live</strong></div>

<p>The Indians
marched him from
one village to another
to show off
their prisoner.
This gave Smith
a chance to learn
a great deal about
the Indians. Some
of them lived in
houses made of the
bark and branches of trees; others had rude huts to
shelter them. Now and then a wigwam was seen large
enough to hold several families.</p>

<p>The Indian warriors painted their bodies to make
themselves look fierce. They carried bows and arrows
and clubs as weapons, for they had no guns at that time.
The men did the hunting and fighting, but in other things
they were lazy. The Indian women not only cared for
the children, did the cooking, and made the clothes, but
also gathered wood, tilled the soil, and built the wigwams.
The Indian wife was the warrior's drudge.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>An
Indian
council
tries
Smith</strong></div>

<p>Smith saw a more wonderful sight still, when he was
led to the village where lived Powhatan. The old chief
had prepared a real surprise for this Englishman. Powhatan,
tall, gaunt, and grim, was wrapped in a robe of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
raccoon skins. He sat upon a bench before the wigwam
fire. His wives sat at his side. Along the walls stood
a row of women with faces and shoulders
painted bright red, and with chains of white
shells about their necks. In front
of the women stood Powhatan's
fierce warriors. This council of
Indians was to decide the fate of
Smith.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Smith's
rescue
by Pocahontas</strong></div>

<p>Two big stones were rolled in
front of Powhatan, and a number
of powerful warriors sprang upon
Smith, dragged him to the stones,
and forced his head upon one of
them. As the warriors stood, clubs
in hand, ready to slay Smith, Pocahontas,
the beautiful twelve-year-old
daughter of Powhatan, rushed
forward, threw her arms around
the prisoner, and begged for his life.</p>

<p>Pocahontas had her way. Powhatan adopted Smith
as a son and set him to making toys for the little maid.
This was strange work for the man who had fought the
Spaniards and slain the Turks, and who was to save a
colony. This story is doubted by some people, but is
believed by many good historians.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Pocahontas

a friend
in need</strong></div>

<p>After a time Smith returned to Jamestown only to find
the settlers facing starvation, and the officers planning
to escape to England in the colony's only vessels. He
promptly arrested the leaders and restored order. In a
few days a band of Indians, led by Pocahontas, entered
the fort. They were loaded down with baskets of corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>The fear of starvation was now gone, because every
few days the little maiden came with food for the settlers.
Ever afterwards they called her "the dear blessed Pocahontas."
She was the good angel of the colony.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Powhatan
refuses
to give
any more
corn</strong></div>

<p>When winter came on, Smith resolved to secure another
supply of corn. But Powhatan had noticed the increase
of settlers and the building of more houses. He feared
that his people might be driven from their hunting
grounds. Smith knew that Powhatan's women had
raised plenty of corn, so immediately sailed up the river
to the old chief's village.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Pocahontas
shows
her
friendship</strong></div>

<p>Powhatan bluntly told Smith he could have no corn
unless he would give a good English sword for each
basketful. Smith promptly refused, and compelled the
Indians to carry the corn on board his boat. That very
night, at the risk of her life, Pocahontas stole through the
woods to tell Smith of her father's plot to kill his men.
They kept close watch all night, and next morning sailed
safely away.</p>

<p>But Smith needed still more corn, and stopped at
another Indian town. Suddenly he found himself and
his men surrounded by several hundred Indian warriors.
A moment's delay, and all would have been over. Smith
rushed into the chief's wigwam, seized him by the scalp-lock,
dragged him out before his astonished warriors,
pointed a pistol at his breast, and demanded corn. He
got it; and the English sailed back to Jamestown with
three hundred bushels of corn on board.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Industry

<p>When spring came Smith resolved that the settlers
must go to work. He called them together and made a
speech declaring that "he that will not work shall not eat.
You shall not only gather for yourself, but for those that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
are sick. They shall not starve." The people in the
colony not only planted more grain, but repaired the
fort and built more and better houses. Thus they grew
happier and more contented with their home in the
Virginia woods.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Smith

<p>Unfortunately for the colony, Smith was wounded so
badly by an explosion of gunpowder that he had to return
to England for medical treatment. The settlers again
fell into idleness after he left, and many of them died.
Still the colony had gained such a foothold that it was
strong enough to live.</p>

<p>Some years later, Smith sailed to America again, explored
the coast from Penobscot Bay to Cape Cod, drew
a map of it, and named the region New England. This
was his last visit to America.</p>


<p><strong>39. Pocahontas.</strong> After John Smith left, Pocahontas
did not visit the English any more. One time she was
seized by an Englishman, put on board a vessel, and
carried weeping to Jamestown.</p>

The marriage of

taken to mean the uniting of the Indians and settlers by
ties of peace and friendship. For several years white
men and red men lived as good neighbors. Rolfe took
Pocahontas to England, where she was received "as

ladies, called on her; and the king and queen received
her at court as if she were a princess of the royal blood.</p>

Here, too, she met her old friend, John Smith. He called
her "Lady Rebecca," as did everybody. But the memory
of other days and other scenes came before her mind.
She covered her face with her hands for a moment, and
then said he must call her "child," and that she would
call him "father." Smith must have thought of the days
when she brought corn to Jamestown to feed his starving
people.</p>

<h3>LORD BALTIMORE, IN A PART OF VIRGINIA, FOUNDS MARYLAND
AS A HOME FOR PERSECUTED CATHOLICS (1634)
AND WELCOMES PROTESTANTS</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Religious
disputes
drove
people to
America</strong></div>


<p><strong>40. A Colony of Catholics and Protestants.</strong> When
the people of England began to change their religion,
some became Puritans, others members of the English
Church, and still others Catholics. Great disputes arose
among the religious sects. There was much persecution.
To escape this, many English people fled to the New
World. The Puritans settled in New England, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the Cavalier members of the English Church found new
homes in Virginia.</p>

<p>George Calvert desired to find a home for his people,
the Catholics. He had studied at Oxford University,
and had been secretary to one of Queen Elizabeth's great
statesmen. When James I became king, he made Calvert
Baron of Baltimore.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Charles I
gives
Baltimore
a part of
Virginia</strong></div>

<p>His successor, Charles I, was also Baltimore's friend,
and when the latter asked the king for permission to
found a colony of Catholics in America, Charles gave
him the whole of what is now Maryland. He also
declared that the colony should bear the name of Maryland
in honor of his queen, Henrietta Maria.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>All permitted
to
worship
as they
pleased</strong></div>

<p>Lord Baltimore immediately began to gather a colony
of emigrants. He welcomed Protestants as well as Catholics,
for it was decided that in the colony of Maryland
all Christians were to have the same rights. Very few
nations in the world at that time permitted people to
worship as they pleased.</p>

<p>Lord Baltimore died before the expedition was ready,
and according to the custom of England, Cecil Calvert,
his eldest son, fell heir to his estate and titles. The
new Lord Baltimore sent more than three hundred persons
in two ships, the <em>Ark</em> and the <em>Dove</em>. The long voyage
had a happy ending; the immigrants reached the mouth
of the Potomac in the springtime, when Maryland is at
the height of its beauty (1634).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Indians
are
friendly</strong></div>

<p>Governor Calvert, in the <em>Dove</em>, sailed up the Potomac.
He decided to locate his little village, which was to be
called St. Mary's, on land occupied by the Indians. He
paid for the land on which the wigwams and cornfields
stood, and the Indians invited the settlers to live with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
them until their log cabins could be built. This good
feeling lasted a long time, and these settlers escaped the
savage wars from which many of the colonists suffered
in the early days.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Annapolis
founded</strong></div>

<p>Many Puritans came into Maryland and settled a town
afterwards named Annapolis. A number of interesting
events took place there in the early days. Later the
city became the home of the famous training school for
the American navy, the United States Naval Academy.</p>

<p>Once Baltimore's authority was taken away because
there were some disputes with a Virginian high in

Baltimore's rule. Later, however, his authority was
restored and religious freedom reëstablished.</p>

<h3>INDUSTRIES, MANNERS, AND CUSTOMS OF FIRST SETTLERS
OF VIRGINIA</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Jamestown
colony
prospers</strong></div>


<p><strong>41. How the Virginia Colonists Lived.</strong> After the first
hardships the colony grew and prospered. Ships continued
to bring settlers from England and other countries of
Europe. In a few years the little settlement at Jamestown
was surrounded on all sides by newly cleared farms.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
planters
grow
rich</strong></div>

<p>To any one living to-day the old colony would seem
strange indeed. There were practically no towns; almost
every one lived on a large farm, called a plantation.
On these plantations were great fields of tobacco, whose
broad leaves in summer almost concealed the ground.
Here and there a field of corn could be seen, but little
else was grown. After a time the owners, or planters,
built themselves great houses and kept an army of servants
to grow the crops and do the work about the house.
The planters did no work with their hands, but looked
after their estates and enjoyed such pleasures as hunting
and horseback riding. Many of these old places were the
scenes of brilliant dinners and balls at which the fine
ladies and gentlemen of the colony gathered.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Negro
slaves
are
brought
to Virginia</strong></div>

<p>Many poor people in England wanted to come to
America, but had no money. To pay for the cost of bringing
them over, these people were forced to work for the
planters, often for six years or more. During this time
they were almost slaves, but at the end of their service they
became free. Then negroes were brought from Africa,
and soon most of the work was done by black slaves.</p>

<p>Tobacco supported the colony and made the planters
wealthy. It bought the food, clothes, and luxuries, and
paid the taxes. It was even used as money, and people
reckoned the value of an article in pounds of tobacco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
as we do in dollars and cents. Most of the crop was
shipped to England. The plantations lay along creeks
or rivers up which boats could sail from the sea. When
the tobacco was cured, it was packed in hogsheads, which
were then rolled on board ship.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A
famous
robber
and
trader</strong></div>


<p><strong>42. Blackbeard the Pirate.</strong> The streams on which the
planters shipped their goods also served as hiding places
for pirates. When these sea robbers had plundered a
ship on the open sea, they would hide away in a bend of
one of the wooded streams. Most famous of these lawless
men was Blackbeard. For years his very name was a
terror to sailors along the coast. He plundered scores of
merchant ships before he was run down and captured.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

<p><strong>43. The Pilgrims.</strong> Persecuted for their religion in
England, the Pilgrims first went to Holland. There
they wandered from place to place, finally settling in the
city of Leiden. But they saw that they could not keep
their own language and customs among the Dutch, so
they decided to go to America and found a colony of
their own. John Carver, William Bradford, William
Brewster, and Edward Winslow were the leaders of the
little band that had chosen to go on the long and dangerous
journey. The parting was sad. Eyes were wet with
weeping and voices were choked with sorrow as the last
words were spoken before going on board the <em>Speedwell</em>.
Even the Dutch bystanders were moved to tears. Listen
to the words of Bradford: "So they left that goodly and
pleasant city which had been their resting place nearly
twelve years; but they knew they were Pilgrims, and
looked not much on those things, but lifted up their
eyes to the heavens, their dearest country, and quieted
their spirits."</p>

<p>The <em>Speedwell</em> carried them across to England, where
they found the <em>Mayflower</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

<p>In August, 1620, the two ships spread their sails for
America. Twice they were forced to return&mdash;once after
they had sailed three hundred miles&mdash;because the <em>Speedwell</em>
was leaking, and her captain declared she would
sink before reaching America.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Storms

<p>Finally the <em>Mayflower</em>, with one hundred two Pilgrims
on board, started alone. Not many days passed
before great storms overtook her. The waves rolled
over her deck and threatened to swallow her. For
many days the passengers had to spend nearly all the
time below deck, not knowing what moment would be
their last. Strained by the storm, the <em>Mayflower</em> also
began to leak, but the stout-hearted Pilgrims would not
turn back.</p>

could not use her sails and was driven far out of her
course, to the northward. The Pilgrims had intended to
land near the mouth of the Hudson, but
on November 20, 1620, the little band of
exiles found themselves looking with glad hearts upon the
sandy but heavily-wooded shores of Cape Cod. How
they poured out their hearts in gratitude that they
had crossed the stormy sea in safety! The men all
gathered in the little cabin of the <em>Mayflower</em> to sign
a compact or an agreement in regard to the government
of the colony. Then they elected John Carver their
first governor.</p>

<p>Everybody was now anxious to get on shore. Captain
Miles Standish, with an exploring party of sixteen men,
each armed with a sword and a musket and equipped
with a corselet, waded ashore through the ice-cold water
and disappeared in the dark forest in search of a good
place to plant the colony.</p>

and run the risk of starvation? They decided to take
only enough to plant in the spring. They afterwards
paid the owners double for what they had taken.</p>

laugh, and learned a new lesson in the art of catching game!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>"Plymouth

<p>On this trip they found the harbor of Plymouth, which
John Smith had explored and named several years before.
Its shore was now to become their home. They immediately
hastened back to the ship to tell the good news, and
in a few days the <em>Mayflower</em> carried the Pilgrims into Plymouth
Harbor. The little party landed on December 21,
1620, and that day is still celebrated as "Forefathers' Day."
The story is that when they landed they stepped on a large
stone&mdash;a bowlder, itself a "pilgrim"&mdash;brought there by the
mighty ice sheet ages ago. This bowlder is called "Plymouth
Rock," and may still be seen in Plymouth.</p>


<p><strong>45. Their Home in the Forest.</strong> Although it was
winter, the men immediately began to chop down trees
and build a great log storehouse which could be used
for a hospital and for worship.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Building
a town
in the
woods</strong></div>

<p>Then they began building their own homes. They
cut down the trees, sawed off the logs, hewed them
roughly, and then dragged them by hand to the place
where the house was to stand. When the logs were
ready the men lifted them up by hand, or when the walls
grew too high for lifting they slid them up "skids."</p>

<p>The roof was made of boards which had been split from
logs of wood. These were held in place by smaller logs.
The wind and rain were kept out by "chinking" or
daubing the cracks between the logs with mortar. The
windows were few and small, for they had no glass and
used oiled skins instead.</p>

<p>This first winter in America was the saddest the Pilgrims
had ever seen. Their storehouse was turned into
a hospital. They had been used to the gentler winters
of England and Holland. Before the warm days of
spring came, one half of the little band had perished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
among them Governor Carver. But the Pilgrims bore
brave hearts, and not a man or woman among those
left went back to England
when the <em>Mayflower</em> sailed.</p>

<p>But the Indians were not so
bad after all, for had it not been
for them, the Pilgrims would
have had a much harder time.
One day while the leaders were talking over military
affairs, they saw a fine-looking Indian coming toward
them. He called out in the English language, "Welcome!
Welcome!" This was a double surprise. The Indian
was Samoset, who had already saved the lives of two
white men taken by the Indians.</p>

<p>In a few days Samoset brought other Indians, dressed
in deer and panther skins. They made the Pilgrims
think of gypsies seen in Holland. Their long black hair
was braided and ornamented with feathers and foxtails.
They sang and danced for the Pilgrims.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Massasoit

<p>When Samoset came again, he brought Squanto, an

the great Indian chief, Massasoit, was coming to visit
his strange neighbors.</p>

escorted into the presence

They agreed not to harm

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What the

<p>Squanto taught the Pilgrims
many new things.
He showed them how to
raise corn by putting dead
fish in the hill when planting
corn, how to hoe the
corn while growing, and
how to pound the corn to make meal. Indian corn
proved to be the Pilgrims' best food crop.</p>

<p>They had no means of fishing, but Squanto taught

the white men also
learned how to make
Indian shoes or moccasins,
and snowshoes,
birch-bark canoes, and
other useful things.</p>

<p>The first summer
was now over and the

had been gathered.
Their houses had been
repaired, and the health<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of the settlers was good. Fish and wild game were
plentiful. They decided that the time for rejoicing and
thanksgiving had also come, and invited Massasoit
and his warriors to join them in the
celebration.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The first
American
Thanksgiving</strong></div>

<p>For three days the games, military movements,
feastings, and rejoicing went on, and
at the end the Pilgrims and Indians were
better friends than before. This was
the beginning of our custom of having
a day of thanksgiving each year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>More

<p>For a whole year the Pilgrims had not
heard a word from the great world across
the sea. How eager they must have
been for just one word from their old homes! One day
the Indians sent runners to tell them that a ship was
in sight. The cannon boomed on the hilltop. Captain
Standish and his men ran for their guns and stood
ready to defend the colony against Spaniards or French.
But it was a ship with news and friends from Leiden
and England.</p>

<p>After a few weeks this ship returned to England loaded
with furs, clapboards, and sassafras to pay those English
merchants who had furnished the Pilgrims the <em>Mayflower</em>
to bring them to America.</p>

<p>An Indian chief, not far away,
decided that he would rather fight
with the Englishmen than be friendly
with them. So he sent a bundle of
arrows, wrapped in a rattlesnake's
skin, to the governor of Plymouth. Squanto told the
Pilgrims that this was an Indian's challenge to war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Bradford's

<p>The Pilgrims were men of peace, but they were not
cowards. Governor Bradford filled the skin with powder
and shot and sent it back to the hostile chief. But the
Indians would not touch it and the chief would not permit
it to be left in his wigwam an hour, but sent it from place
to place, until it again reached Plymouth.</p>

<p>Thus the Pilgrims went on year by year, living in peace
when they could, but fighting when they must. Every
year or so new settlers came from their old homes, and
the colony grew slowly, but steadily.</p>

<p><strong>47. The Puritans.</strong> While the Pilgrims were planting
their home on the lonely American shore, the Puritans
in England were being cruelly persecuted by Charles I.
So great became their sufferings and dangers that the
Puritan leaders decided to go to America, where they
could worship as they pleased. Charles I, fortunately,
gave them a very good charter. But even before this,
some of the Puritans had already planted a colony at
Salem.</p>

<p><strong>48. John Winthrop.</strong> The Puritan leaders elected
John Winthrop governor of the new colony. In the spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
of 1630, nearly ten years after the <em>Mayflower</em> sailed,
more than seven hundred Puritans, in eleven ships, bade
good-by to their beautiful English
homes, crossed the ocean,
and settled in what is now
Boston.</p>

<p>John Winthrop, the leader
and governor of the Colony of
Massachusetts Bay, the name
given to the Salem and Boston
settlements, was then about
forty years old, and had been
in college at Cambridge, in
England. He was a man of
high social position.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What the
Puritans
gave up</strong></div>

<p>The Puritans who came with
Winthrop were people of property,
and not only parted from
friends and kindred when they
came to the wild shores of America, but both men and
women gave up lives of comfort and pleasure for lives
of suffering and hardship. In America, the men had to
cut down trees, work in the fields, and fight Indians.
Only brave men and women act in this way. But no
one among them gave up more or was willing to suffer
more than their leader. The people elected him governor
almost every year until his death, in 1649.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Character
of
Winthrop</strong></div>

<p>John Winthrop was a firm man with many noble qualities,
and not once, while governor, did he do anything
merely to please the people if he thought it wrong.</p>

<p>When a leading man in the colony sent him a bitter
letter, he returned it saying that he did not wish to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
near him so great a cause of ill feeling. This answer made
the writer Winthrop's friend. When food was scarce
in the colony, Winthrop divided his last bit of bread
with the poor, and worked with his laborers in the fields.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Many

<p>While Winthrop was ruling the colony, hundreds of
settlers came and settled many other towns around
Boston, and the Massachusetts Bay Colony grew large
in the number of its people. Later the old Plymouth
Colony was united with it to form one colony. But
these settlers did not always agree, especially in regard
to religion and government.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Eliot

the
Bible</strong></div>


<p><strong>49. John Eliot.</strong> The treatment of the Indians by
the colonists was generally just and kind. Trading with
the white man had brought the Indians better food
and clothing.
Schools were being
set up to give
them some of the
white man's education,
and many
preachers tried to
teach them to become
Christians.
One man who
spent his whole
life in this work
was John Eliot.
His first care was
to learn the language of the Indians of Massachusetts.
He succeeded so well that he was able to translate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
entire Bible into the Indian language and to preach to the
Indians in their native tongue.</p>

<p>The converts that he made he gathered together into
communities which settled near the English towns.
These converts were taught how to build themselves log
cabins and to live and dress like the English. The principal
village established by Eliot was at Natick, Massachusetts.
Others quickly followed Eliot's example, and
several other Christian Indian villages sprang up. These
communities flourished, and in a few years Eliot could
count as many as four thousand converts among the
Indians of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Eliot continued to preach until his death in 1690.
Even the fierce King Philip's War could not check his
success.</p>

<h3>KING PHILIP, INDIAN CHIEF AND HATER OF WHITE MEN</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Indians
are
persecuted</strong></div>


<p><strong>50. King Philip.</strong> After the death of old Massasoit
the friendship between Pilgrims and Indians soon came
to an end. More and more white settlers came in and
built homes. The Indians began to fear that they would
be crowded out of the country which belonged to them
and to their fathers before them. No longer were they
treated with respect as at first. They were a proud people,
and grew bitter because they saw that they were despised.</p>

<p>One of the proudest of the race was Philip, son of
Massasoit and ruler of his people. Several times the
governor of Plymouth forced him to do things against
his will. This hurt the pride of Philip, and he began to
hate the English. His own people also came to him frequently
with complaints against the white men. Philip
grew surly, while the colonists began to distrust him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>The bad feeling grew on both sides, and gradually
both Indians and colonists came to believe all the evil
stories that were told of each other. Both sides collected
arms, powder, and lead. After a short while war with all
its horrors began. The Indians burned many villages and
massacred hundreds of white men, women, and children.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Philip
is

and
killed</strong></div>

<p>There was much fighting, and finally the Indians were
completely defeated. Most of the braves were killed;
those who were captured were sold as slaves. Philip's
family was killed or captured. He himself fled to a
swamp, where he met death at the hands of one of his
own people.</p>

<h3>INDUSTRIES, MANNERS, AND CUSTOMS</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Pilgrims
have
a hard
struggle</strong></div>


<p><strong>51. How the New England Colonists Lived.</strong> The
Puritans and the Pilgrims had a hard struggle in their
new homes. The winters were long and colder than in
England. For the cold weather they had to build warm
houses and barns, and store up much grain, hay, and
provisions. The summers were cool and short; tobacco
and even corn did not ripen so well as in Virginia. Most
of the land was hilly and stony and hard to cultivate.
But these things did not discourage the settlers, who
merely worked so much harder. Soon they raised all
the corn, wheat, cattle, and sheep they needed, and even
had some left to sell. Where the streams had waterfalls
they built mills with big water wheels. In these they
ground their flour and meal and sawed their lumber.</p>

<p>While the men farmed the land, or ran mills, or fished,
the women also did their share of the work. They made
butter and cheese, spun and wove the wool into cloth, and
made many other things which now we buy from stores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Pilgrims
build
towns
and
villages</strong></div>

<p>Unlike the Virginia colonists, many people of New England
lived in towns and villages. They built churches,
schools, and town halls. All the people went to church.
Most of the children attended school. Whenever any
question arose in which every one was interested, they
talked it over at the town meeting. In these ways the
New England colonists differed from the Virginians.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Goes to
New
Netherland</strong></div>

<p>In an attack on a Portuguese fort Stuyvesant lost a leg
and had to return to Holland. As soon as he was well the
Dutch West India Company
sent him to New Netherland
(1647) to save that colony
from the Indians.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What
Stuyvesant
said
to the
settlers</strong></div>

<p>The arrival of Stuyvesant,
with his little army
and fleet of four vessels,
brought great joy to the
discouraged settlers and fur
traders. He said to the
people: "I shall reign over
you as a father over his children."
But he ruled the
colony far more like a king
than a father. He was not
only commander in chief of the army, but was also lawmaker,
judge, and governor, all in one.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Strict
order in
New
Amsterdam</strong></div>

<p>The new laws made by Stuyvesant showed that he intended
to keep order in the colony. He forbade Sabbath-breaking,
drunkenness, the sale of drink to the Indians
or to any one else after the nine o'clock bell had rung.
He ordered the owners of all vacant lots in New Amsterdam
to improve them, and tried to fix the location of all
new buildings. He taxed traders, whether they shipped
goods to Europe or brought goods into New Netherland.</p>

<p>Stuyvesant did, indeed, restore order to the colony,
but he stirred up the people until they demanded a voice
in the government. He finally agreed that they might
select nine of their wisest men to advise with him. They
were called the council. He had no idea of following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
anybody's advice unless it agreed with his own notions,
but the people had gained something.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Stuyvesant
and
his
neighbors</strong></div>

<p>At the same time Stuyvesant was just as busy with his
neighbors' affairs. He quarreled with the English in New
England, as well as with the patroons in his own colony.</p>

<p>Stuyvesant claimed all the region now included in New
Jersey, a large part of that in the states of New York,
Delaware, and Pennsylvania, and also a part of the territory
of New England.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Government
by the
people
demanded</strong></div>

<p>The colony grew in numbers. New towns sprang up
along the Hudson and on Long Island. But the increase
in the number of the towns only made the call for a
government by the people still louder.</p>

<p>For several years the dispute between the people and
the governor went on until, one day in 1664, news came
that a fleet of English war vessels was in sight. Although
England and Holland were at peace, the English king had
given New Netherland to his brother, the Duke of York,
and the English fleet had come to take it for the duke.</p>

<p>Governor Stuyvesant was resolved to defend the colony

were not willing to fight for a governor who had given

<p>The commander of the fleet sent a letter to Stuyvesant

wanted the governor to surrender, but he grew angry,
tore the letter to pieces, and declared he would never
give up. The council put the pieces of the letter together
and read it to the people. The minister of his own
church begged the governor not to fight, and leading
citizens, and mothers with their children, pleaded with
Stuyvesant to surrender. Now what could the brave
old Dutchman do? He could not fight a whole fleet
alone. He turned sadly away, saying, "I would rather
go to my grave than to surrender the city."</p>

<h3>MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF NEW NETHERLAND</h3>


<p><strong>54. Life in New Netherland.</strong> The Dutch colonists
brought with them the quaint and simple ways of their
old home in Holland&mdash;the land of dikes and windmills.
Even long years after the colony had passed into the
hands of the English, many places in New York remained
Dutch in customs and appearance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
colonists
built
houses
like
those in
Holland</strong></div>

<p>New Amsterdam looked for all the world like a city
back in Holland. The houses were built solidly. They
stood close to the street and had high, steep roofs with
gable ends that were like series of steps. On the front
of each house large iron numerals told the year in which
it was built. On the roof were curious weathervanes.</p>

<p>About the fireplace the family gathered in the evening.
The burgher would tell jovial stories to the children as
he smoked his long pipe. The good wife, resting from
her day's work, found some needlework to busy her
fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dutch wives were famous housekeepers and prided
themselves on their spotless homes. They scoured and
scrubbed from morning to night. But they also knew
how to make doughnuts and crullers and to cook good
dishes that made their husbands round and good-natured
and their children rosy and plump.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Dutch
liked
merrymaking</strong></div>

<p>The Dutch liked merrymaking and good times far
better than did their Puritan neighbors. The big brass
knocker on the door&mdash;shaped generally like the head of
some animal&mdash;was kept busy in the afternoon by people
coming to drink tea or coffee. A great copper kettle, hung
in the fireplace, furnished enough to drink for every one,
and sweet cookies were always on hand. They celebrated
many holidays. At Christmas we still look for old Santa
Claus, whom the Dutch first brought to this country.</p>

<p>In Holland the burghers had been good farmers and
shrewd merchants. When they came to this country
they continued to make their living chiefly in these two
ways. On Long Island and along the Hudson River
were fine farms with well-kept fields and large gardens.
The merchants mostly lived at New Amsterdam, which
soon became a busy seaport. Here many sailing vessels
lay at anchor and exchanged their cargoes for the products
of the Dutch farms and of the Indian trade. From
the small beginnings made by these Dutch merchants
has grown the largest city of the western world.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM PENN, THE QUAKER, WHO FOUNDED THE CITY
OF BROTHERLY LOVE</h3>


<p><strong>55. William Penn.</strong> One day Thomas Loe, a Quaker
preacher, ventured into the old university town of
Oxford. He talked with the students and explained to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
them the beliefs of the Quakers. He declared that all
men were equal, and he refused to recognize rank or
title. He taught men to live and worship in simplicity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>William
Penn
converted</strong></div>

<p>A few students believed his teachings and resolved to
become members of the hated sect of Quakers. Among
them was William Penn, the son of a great naval officer,
Admiral Penn. What a buzzing there was in that old
college town when the news spread that William Penn,
the fine scholar, the skilled oarsman, the all-round athlete,
had become a Quaker!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Why
Penn
was expelled
from
college</strong></div>

<p>Some of his comrades would not believe it. But when
they saw him put off the cap and gown of his college,
which some of the greatest men in English history had
worn with pride, and put on the plain garb of the Quakers,
they gave up! The college officers were also convinced
when Penn and other Quakers tore off the gowns of fellow
students. The authorities promptly expelled these young
and over-enthusiastic Friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What
Penn's
family
and
friends
thought</strong></div>

<p>What more disgraceful thing could happen to the family
of Admiral Penn? To have a son expelled from Oxford
was bad enough, but to have him become a Quaker was
a disgrace not to be borne&mdash;so thought his family. The
stern old admiral promptly drove him from home. But
William resolutely refused to give up his Quaker views,
and the admiral decided to try the plan of sending him
to Paris, where life was as un-Quaker-like as it could be.</p>

<p>William Penn himself looked little like a Quaker. He
was then eighteen years old, fine looking, with large eyes
and long, dark, curly hair reaching to his shoulders.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Penn in
Paris</strong></div>

<p>Young Penn, however, did not entirely waste his time
in the gay life of Paris. He attended school and traveled
in Italy. At the end of two years he came back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Returns
more of
a Quaker
than ever</strong></div>

<p>It was not long before the admiral again saw Quaker
signs in his son and hastened him off to Ireland to cure
him entirely. But who should be preaching in Ireland
but Thomas Loe. William went to hear his old preacher,
and this time became a Quaker forever. No suffering
was great enough to cause him ever to waver again,
although fines were heaped on him and at four different
times he was thrown into foul jails to be the companion
of criminals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Penn

hat</strong></div>

<p>Penn's family now felt the disgrace very keenly, but
his father promised to forgive him if he would take off
his hat to the king, to the king's brother, and to his
father. One day, the story goes, King Charles, the
merry monarch, met
William Penn and
others. All hats
were promptly removed
except the
king's and Penn's.
Presently the king,
too, removed his
hat. Whereupon,
Penn said: "Friend
Charles, why dost
thou remove thy
hat?" The king
replied: "Because,
wherever I am, it is
customary for but
one to remain covered."</p>

<p>Penn's father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
would not permit such conduct toward his royal friends.
He therefore drove his son from his home a second time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>William

<p>But Penn's mother finally made peace between the
father and the son before the admiral died. William
Penn, then but twenty-six years old, came into possession
of a fortune. Once more he stood "where the roads
parted." He could now be a great man and play the
part of a fine English gentleman who would always be
welcome at court, or he could remain a Quaker.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Turns to
America</strong></div>

<p>We do not know that he even thought of forsaking
his Quaker comrades. On the contrary, he resolved to
devote his fortune and his life to giving them relief.
Like Winthrop for the Puritans and Baltimore for the
Catholics, Penn thought of America for his persecuted
Friends. With other Quaker leaders, he became an
owner of West Jersey, part of New Jersey.</p>

owed Penn's father about eighty thousand dollars.
William Penn asked him to pay it in American land.
Charles was only too glad to grant
this request of the son of his old
sea captain. The land he gave to
Penn is the present great state of
Pennsylvania. Penn wanted the colony
called Sylvania, meaning woodland,
but the king declared it should
be called Pennsylvania in memory of
Admiral Penn.</p>

<p>By means of letters and pamphlets
Penn sent word to the Quakers
throughout England, Scotland, and
Ireland. He told them of Quaker homes across the
sea, where jails would not trouble them.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing among them over Penn's
"Holy Experiment," as his plan was called.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Penn

<p>Penn even visited Europe, especially
the country along the
Rhine, and told the persecuted
and oppressed about the new
colony where every sort of Christian
was to find a hearty welcome,
and where no one was to be
punished for religion's sake.</p>

<p>Hundreds of settlers hastened
to the new colony. When Penn
reached Newcastle on the Delaware
in the fall of 1682 he met a
hearty welcome from scores of happy people who were
already enjoying their long-wished-for religious freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>One of Penn's first acts was to call a meeting of the
colonists to talk over their government. This pleased
the people greatly, for although the land was Penn's
he not only gave them land for their houses and farms,
but he also gave them the right to choose their own rulers
and to make their own laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

<p>Penn next turned his attention to founding the great
Quaker city to which he gave the name Philadelphia,
signifying brotherly love&mdash;a name truly expressing
Penn's feeling toward other men. He marked off the
streets right in the midst of a great forest, and called
them Walnut, Mulberry, Chestnut, and so on, after
the trees that grew there. Some of the streets in Philadelphia
are still so named.</p>

along the river. Philadelphia grew faster than the other
colonial towns, and soon led them all.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Penn

<p>William Penn won the love and the respect of the
Indians of Pennsylvania. He visited them in their own
towns and ate with them. He even took part in their
athletic games and outran them all. Like Roger Williams,
he believed that the Indians should be paid for their
lands. Accordingly, he made them rich gifts and entered
into solemn treaties with the chiefs.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Kind

<p>At a treaty under a great elm tree on the banks of the

are all one flesh and one blood." In return the Indians
said: "We will live in love with William Penn and his

<p>The news of the establishment of free government and

and there their children's children are to be found to-day
under the name of the "Pennsylvania Dutch." Without
boasting, William Penn could say that no other one man,
at his own expense, had planted so great a colony in the
wilds of America as he had. Few nobler men ever lived
than William Penn. He died July 30, 1718.</p>

<h3>QUAKER WAYS IN OLD PENNSYLVANIA</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Believed
in
simple
things</strong></div>


<p><strong>57. How Quakers Differed from other Colonists.</strong>
The people who formed Penn's colony were unlike those
of any of the other settlements. They did not wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
gorgeous clothes and jewelry like the Virginia cavaliers.
The men carried no swords or pistols. They were not
stern like the Puritans. Games and social pleasures
were not to be seen among them as in Dutch New
Netherland.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Quakers
called
themselves
the
Society
of
Friends</strong></div>

<p>These people wore clothes of the plainest cut, made
from dull gray or brown cloth. They were gentle and
soft-spoken, and did not fight or quarrel among themselves.
People who did not understand or like them
called them Quakers, because some of them were so
carried away at religious meetings that they fell to
quaking. They themselves took the name of the Society
of Friends. And Friends is a much better name, for they
were friends to every man.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>All
religions
welcomed
by the
Friends</strong></div>

<p>The customs of the Quakers grew out of their religious
views. Above all, they believed that every one should
be free to do as his own conscience taught him. Their
religious meetings were as simple as their own lives.
They did not think it necessary to have ministers or
priests. The men sat in one part of the church, the
women in another. All was silence until some Friend felt
called to speak. Some days no one spoke, and then they
all sat in silence until the meeting was over. As a rule,
not even a hymn was sung.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Opposed
war
and
slavery</strong></div>

<p>The Quakers have always believed that war is unnecessary
and wrong, and only a few of them have ever carried
arms. Because Friends speak only the truth, they do
not take an oath. In the courts of law their simple word
is as good as an oath. They have always been quick to
help the poor and oppressed. The Quakers were the
first to oppose slavery, and they did much to end it both
in this country and in the English colonies. It is strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
that these kind, gentle people should ever have been so
cruelly persecuted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
colony
prospered</strong></div>

<p>While the Quakers were strongly religious, they also
took good heed of the things of this world. At first they
cleared and planted farms in the fertile Schuylkill and
Delaware valleys. Soon groups of them took up townships
of five thousand acres each and built villages at
their centers. The swift streams which tumbled down
the mountain slopes they used to turn mills. In these
they ground flour, sawed lumber, made paper, and wove
woolen cloth.</p>

<p>The rich land and good climate of Pennsylvania and its
liberal government attracted many people from outside.
After a short time the Quakers were outnumbered by
the other settlers, and to-day the Quakers are but a
handful in that great state.</p>

<p><strong>58. A Friend of the Unfortunate.</strong> James Oglethorpe

that strong-bodied men, to say nothing of women and
children, soon sickened and died in them. Besides, he
found that the jailers were often bad men, who whipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the prisoners on their bare backs and stole their food.</p>

<p>The prison was a poor place for a man in debt, anyway.
How could a man pay

<div class="sidenote"><strong>King

<p>Oglethorpe, like many
other noble men before
him, thought of America
as a place of refuge
for the unfortunate.
King George II gave
him a charter for the
land between the Savannah
and the Altamaha,
and made his heart glad
by declaring that all
Protestants should be
tolerated there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A select
body of
emigrants</strong></div>

<p>When the debtors
heard the news that
Oglethorpe was to plant
a colony for them there was great excitement among
them. But he carefully selected his settlers, so that no
lazy man might be found among them. Arms and tools
with which to work on the farms were given to the settlers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>At
Charleston</strong></div>

<p>When the time came, thirty families were ready to sail.
Oglethorpe carried them direct to Charleston, South
Carolina. When they landed, in 1733, the people of
Charleston were only too glad to have a colony south of
them as a "buffer" against the Spaniards who occupied
Florida, and who had already attacked South Carolina.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Savannah

<p>Therefore, the people of Charleston, to give the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
colony a good start, presented the settlers with one hundred
head of cattle, a drove of hogs, and fifteen or twenty
barrels of rice. Rejoicing in their new supplies, the
colony sailed to the Savannah River, and not far from its
mouth, on a beautiful bluff, Oglethorpe marked out the
streets of the new city. The settlers went to work with
a will, cutting down trees and making them into cabins.
They soon had comfortable homes, although very different
from what they had known in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Italians</strong></div>

<p>Soon other colonists came to Savannah. Among these
was a company of Italians who had come to raise the
silkworm and to manufacture silk.</p>

<p>In the next year after Oglethorpe planted the settlement
a band of sturdy German Protestants arrived.
These settlers built their homes to the north of Savannah,
and called the colony "Ebenezer," which means
"the Lord hath helped us." Between these two settlements
a band of pious Moravian immigrants founded

<h3>INDUSTRIES, MANNERS, AND CUSTOMS OF THE
SOUTHERN PLANTERS</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Farms
near the
sea</strong></div>


<p><strong>59. The Carolina and Georgia Planters.</strong> The colonial
farms south of Virginia lay mostly in a narrow strip
near the sea. Inland were the "pine barrens," a poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
sandy country grown up in pine woods. Inland also
were strong and fierce tribes of Indians like the Cherokees
and Creeks.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Rice
becomes
an
important
product</strong></div>

<p>The younger colonies could not live by growing tobacco.
Virginia was nearer to the English market, and supplied
it with most of the tobacco needed. They did raise corn
and cattle for their own use. One day a ship captain
from the Orient sailed into Charleston with some rice.
The story runs that he gave a few handfuls of this to
the governor as a curiosity. The wise old governor
heard that this rice had been grown in swamps, and he
thought of the swamps all along the coast of Carolina
and Georgia. He had some of it planted in this wet
land, and it grew beyond all hopes. In a few years rice
was produced in such quantity that it could be shipped to
England, where it was thought the best on the market.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Indigo
also
grown</strong></div>

<p>Some one else discovered that the low, wet land would
also grow indigo, a plant used for making a brilliant
and valuable blue dye. Indigo soon brought the settlers
as much money as did the rice.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lumber,
tar, and
turpentine</strong></div>

<p>The great pine woods furnished lumber that was sent
to Europe by the boatload. From the sap of the pine
trees the colonists also learned to make turpentine and
rosin. By heating or distilling the wood itself they
produced tar. To this day one of the most striking
sights in these states are the great sawmills and the
stills, where negroes are making turpentine much as it
was made a century and a half ago.</p>

<p>When Georgia was settled Oglethorpe did not permit
slaves to be brought in, and the colonists had to do all
their own work. But later there were as many slaves in
Georgia as in the Carolinas or Virginia.</p>

<h3>LA SALLE PUSHED FORWARD THE WORK BEGUN BY JOLIET
AND MARQUETTE</h3>


<p><strong>60. Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle.</strong> While
Joliet and Marquette were on their long journey, Frontenac
was making use of another fur trader, La Salle, and
of another missionary, Hennepin. La Salle belonged to
a rich French family, and had left home at the age of
twenty-three (1666) for the wild life in the American
forests.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Fort
Frontenac
built</strong></div>

<p>He first built a fort-like post just above Montreal and
named it Lachine, because he supposed it was located on
the route to China. In 1673 he helped build Fort Frontenac
where the Canadian city of Kingston now stands.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>LA SALLE</p>

<p><em>Reproduced from a design based on an
old engraving</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>La Salle returned home, and the king received him
with honor and made him governor of the region around
Fort Frontenac. He came
back and built a great stone
fort. Settlers soon came and
built their cabins around the
fort, making a little frontier
village.</p>

<p>Here the fur trader came
each season with his pack,
and here the faithful missionary
said good-by before
plunging into the wilds of
the unknown wilderness, perhaps
never to return.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>La Salle
not content
to
get rich
only</strong></div>

<p>La Salle was growing rich,
but he longed to make good his country's right to the
richer soil and to the milder climate of the Mississippi
Valley. Once more he returned to France, and the king
gave him permission to explore the great valley and to
build forts along the way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Hennepin
and
his altar</strong></div>

<p>La Salle came back bringing sailors, carpenters,
anchors, and cables, for he intended to build a ship on
the lakes. But best of all, he brought Tonti, his faithful
Italian friend and helper. Hennepin, the missionary,
carried an altar so made that he could strap it on his back
and set it up for worship wherever he chose.</p>

<p>La Salle had resolved to build his first fort at the mouth
of the Niagara River, but the Iroquois permitted him to
build only a large storehouse. They were greatly displeased
when he set about building a ship above Niagara to
sail the Great Lakes to the west, and threatened to burn it.</p>

River and
then into

There was

cannon, all was astir in that town of fur
traders, missionaries, and Indians. La
Salle's men landed with great show.
They marched to the little chapel and
knelt before the altar.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

<p>La Salle then sailed through the straits
and to the head of Green Bay, where
some of his men, sent out many months
before, had collected a great quantity
of furs. Laden with these, the <em>Griffin</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
sailed for the storehouse on the Niagara, but La Salle
never saw again this first ship of the lakes.</p>


<p><strong>61. Exploring the Mississippi Valley.</strong> With fourteen
men in four large canoes, La Salle set out for the Illinois
River. They passed southward along the Wisconsin
shore, sometimes living only on parched corn and wild
berries, but at other times feasting on the wild game
killed by their Indian hunter.</p>

of thirty men and fourteen canoes paddled up the St.
Joseph River to where South Bend now is. From this
point the party, carrying canoes and baggage, made its
way over to the headwaters of the Illinois. They were
glad to reach the region near the present site of Ottawa,
where Marquette had been a few years before. They
saw Buffalo Rock and Starved Rock, high bluffs renowned
in Indian history.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Surprising

<p>Just as the little fleet was passing through Peoria

excitement, but La Salle talked peace to the chiefs while
Hennepin tried to quiet the children.</p>

there through the
winter (1680). They
named it Fort Crèvecœur,
meaning that
the builders had
grieved until their
hearts were broken.</p>

<p>La Salle returned
to Fort Frontenac.
In the meantime
he ordered Tonti to
fortify Starved Rock, and Hennepin to explore the Illinois
and the upper Mississippi rivers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Iroquois

<p>While La Salle was gone, a great army of fierce Iroquois
destroyed the villages of the Illinois Indians, "the

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A union

<p>La Salle's heart was indeed full of grief when he returned
and saw the awful desolation where once stood the
villages of his Indian friends. But worse still, he could
not find Tonti. With a sad but brave heart the great
leader resolved to bring all the Illinois tribes into a union
that should be a match for the Iroquois. He went from
tribe to tribe, and night after night he sat around the
council fires with the chiefs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>La Salle
journeys
to the
mouth of
the Mississippi</strong></div>

<p>Before he could unite them he heard that Tonti was
safe at Mackinac. He hastened to meet his long-lost
friend, and there he and Tonti once more planned the
exploration of the lower Mississippi. He returned to
Fort Frontenac, collected supplies, and was soon crossing
the portage between the Chicago and Illinois rivers.
On they went, till early in February their canoes floated
out upon the bosom of the "Father of Waters" (1682).</p>

<p>Down the river they floated, passing the Missouri,
the Ohio, and the Arkansas, where Joliet and Marquette
had turned back. With the kindly help of new guides,
they passed on until they found the Mississippi branching
into three streams. La Salle divided his party, and
each took a stream to the Gulf.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>La Salle

country</strong></div>

<p>On shore, just above the mouth, a cross was raised and
La Salle took possession of all the country he had explored
"in the name of Louis the Great, King of France."
The company shouted, "Long live the king!" La Salle's
first great object had been accomplished.</p>

<p>Then the party began the slow journey up stream.
La Salle finally reached Mackinac, and there again began
to lay great plans. The first thing he did was to go to
Starved Rock and build a fort for the protection of his
union of Indian tribes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Builds

<p>Starved Rock is a rough cliff which rises one hundred
thirty-five feet high, right out of the valley. Its sides
are almost perpendicular. La Salle and his men cut
away the trees on top and built storehouses, log huts,
and a palisade. They named it Fort St. Louis. In the
valley below, hundreds of Indians came and built their
wigwams that they might be safe from their enemies, the
Iroquois. Tonti was put in command of the fort.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>La Salle

<p>La Salle's next step was to return to France and ask
the king to plant a colony of Frenchmen at the mouth
of the Mississippi
River. The king
agreed, and La
Salle set sail for
the Gulf of Mexico
with a fleet
of four ships and
a colony of more
than one hundred
fifty persons
(1684). But he
missed the Mississippi
and landed
at Matagorda Bay in Texas. The colonists blamed
La Salle. He tried in vain to find the Mississippi.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>La Salle's

<p>Suffering and discontent increased until a party of
La Salle's men lay in ambush and shot him, and left his

the faithful Tonti at Starved Rock heard of the sad fate

<h3>THE "FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY"</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Washington's
birthday
and birthplace</strong></div>


<p><strong>63. George Washington as a Boy.</strong> When Washington
was born, February 22, 1732, in the old colony of Virginia,
the early settlements had grown into towns, and planters
had prospered. His father's house stood upon a gentle
hill slope which ran down to the lazily flowing Potomac.
Across the river one could see the wooded Maryland
shore, broken with a few great farms and plantations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
mother
of Washington</strong></div>

<p>Washington's father owned more than one plantation,
and had many negro slaves. He was also a partner in
some iron mines, and once had been captain of a ship
carrying iron ore to London. It was in London that he
had fallen in love with Mary Ball, called, on account of
her beauty, the "Rose of Epping Forest." She, too, was
a Virginian, and she married Augustine Washington, and
became the greatly revered mother of George.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>School
in Fredericksburg</strong></div>

<p>When George was but three years old his parents
moved to the plantation on the Rappahannock. Across
the river, in the old town of Fredericksburg, George went
to a school taught by the church sexton. Both teachers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and schools were scarce in Virginia then because the
people lived miles apart on their great plantations.</p>

</div>

<p>In Washington's
day the plantations
were usually located
on the rivers or
bays. The rivers
were the best roadways
in those old
times. Besides, the
planter was glad
to have the yearly
ship from London
stop at his door.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
yearly
ship from
London</strong></div>

<p>The coming of the ship brought happy days to the
young people, for it often brought furniture for the house
and fine clothes for the family. Sometimes, too, it
brought back some long-absent son or daughter, or letters
from relatives in the old English home. Then there
were the stories such as only sailors can tell.</p>

<p>When all the stores of tobacco and grain had been
loaded, once more the great ship spread her wings and
sailed away. Then many a Virginia boy longed to go
on board and sail away, too.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Mary
Washington</strong></div>

<p>George's father died and left him, at the age of eleven,
to the care of his mother. Mary Washington was a wise,
firm mother, and always held the love and admiration
of her children.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
eldest
son in
Virginia</strong></div>

<p>According to the custom of those old Virginia days, the
eldest son, Lawrence Washington, received the beautiful
plantation on the Potomac, which he named Mount
Vernon in honor of Admiral Vernon, an English naval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
officer under whom he had fought in the West Indies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>George
studied
hard and

<p>To George fell a smaller plantation on the Rappahannock.
He could hardly hope to go to England to
study, but went to a school near his birthplace. Here
he studied hard, mastering mathematics, and business
papers of all sorts. The book into which he copied
business letters, deeds, wills, and bills of sale and exchange
shows how careful he was and how he mastered everything
he undertook.</p>

<p>At school, George was a spirited leader in all outdoor
sports. He outran, outjumped, as well as outwrestled
all his comrades. He could throw farther than any of
them. The story is told that he once threw a stone across
the Rappahannock, and that at another time he threw
a stone from the valley below to the top of the Natural
Bridge, a distance of more than two hundred feet.</p>

plantation had fine riding horses. People lived so far apart
that they had to ride horseback when they visited each
other and when they went to church or to
town. Whether George rode a wild colt to
"break" it, or whether he rode with his
neighbors through woods and fields, jumping
fences or swimming streams, or in a wild chase
after the fox, he always kept his seat.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A woodsman</strong></div>

<p>Even while a boy Washington was learning
the ways of a woodsman. With only a
gun and a dog for companions, he made long
trips into the deep, dark Virginia forests,
where no road or path showed the way. He
could cross rivers without bridge or boat,
could build a shelter at night, could trap,
and shoot, and cook over the fire by the
side of which he slept. All this knowledge
was soon put to use by Washington.</p>

perhaps an officer on one of
the king's great war ships.
But when all was ready, he
gave up his plans to please

<p>George was now more and more at Mount Vernon,
where he met many fine people. Among these visitors
he admired most an old English nobleman, Lord Fairfax,
who had come to spend the rest of his days beyond the
Blue Ridge in the beautiful valley of the Shenandoah.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A surveyor

<p><strong>64. Washington as Surveyor.</strong> Lord Fairfax was

old. Accordingly, one spring Washington, with a number
of companions, started over the mountains to survey the
wild lands of Lord Fairfax.</p>

<p>The trip was full of danger. There were no roads,
bridges, or houses after the party reached the mountains;
but deep rivers, wild animals, and savage Indians were
plentiful. Some nights they slept in rude huts, other
nights in tents, but more often under the stars and
around the camp fire. One night they saw a party of Indians
dance their

belonged to Lord Fairfax. Few men could have done
better, and a warm friendship grew up between this
white-haired English
nobleman and the young
Virginian. Lord Fairfax
immediately built a great
hunting lodge in the
Shenandoah, near where
Winchester is, and named
it Greenway Court. It
became a favorite visiting
place for many Virginians.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A public

<p>Washington had done
his work so well that
Lord Fairfax had him

Court his headquarters.</p>

<p>For three years Washington was hard at work in that
western wilderness marking out the lands of settlers.
It was a rough but health-giving life and made his bones
and muscles strong. He had to take many risks and
face many dangers.</p>

<p>Once he wrote to a friend: "Since you received my

nights in a bed; but, after walking a great deal all the

Suddenly Washington's whole life was changed. His
brother Lawrence died and left to George the beautiful
Mount Vernon home and the care of his only daughter.
At the age of twenty Washington found himself at the
head of two large plantations. But he had hardly begun
his new duties before he was called to serve his governor
and the king.</p>

<p>The French in Canada were building a chain of outposts
from Lake Erie into Pennsylvania to the headwaters
of the Ohio River so that they might have a shorter
route to their trading posts on the Mississippi. Governor
Dinwiddie of Virginia had sent orders for them to get
out of the country, but his messenger did not get within
a hundred miles of the French soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>It was probably Lord Fairfax who said to the governor:
"Here is the very man for you; young and daring, but
sober minded and responsible, who only lacks opportunity
to show the stuff that is in him."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>George

<p>In October, 1753, Washington, not then twenty-two,
set out with servants, horses, and two companions for
the French posts. One companion was the old Dutch
soldier who had taught Washington to use the sword,
and the other was the famous backwoodsman, Christopher
Gist. They pushed on through deep forests, over the
mountains, across swift rivers, to the Indian village near
where Pittsburgh now stands. From there Washington
hurried on to the fort on French Creek.</p>

<p>The French commander received him with great
politeness, and tried to keep him many days. But
Washington saw that the French were really preparing
to fight to hold this "gateway to the West."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The trip
back to
Virginia</strong></div>

<p>The Frenchmen very politely said that they intended
to hold that region at all hazard. Washington and his
party at once started back with the answer.</p>

<p>Washington's party traveled through rain and snow,
hurrying through dense forests where savages lurked
ready to scalp them. An Indian shot at Washington,
but missed him. Their horses gave out, and Washington
and Gist plunged into the forest alone, on foot, anxious
to lose no time. At last they reached Williamsburg.</p>

<p>War now seemed certain, and the governor hurried
Washington forward with about one hundred fifty men

But the French had already reached and built Fort
Duquesne, where the Ohio is formed, and were then

had come up the Potomac; and soldiers, cannon,
and supplies were passing right by the doors of Mount
Vernon. Every day Washington looked upon the king's
soldiers, and saw the flash of sword and bayonet. How
could he keep out of it? General Braddock liked the
young Virginian, and made him an officer on his staff.</p>

<p>Braddock was a brave man, but he had never made war
in the woods, or against Indians. One day Washington
suggested that a long train of heavily loaded wagons
would make the march very, very slow. He was thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
of Indians. Braddock only smiled, as if to say that a
young backwoodsman could not teach him how to fight.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Braddock

<p>Benjamin Franklin, a very wise man from Philadelphia,
was also troubled when he thought of how the Indians

as they marched through the deep, dark forests. Braddock
smiled again, and said: "These savages may be
dangerous to the raw American militia, but it is impossible
that they should make any impression on the king's
troops."</p>

Braddock forced his men to stand

when he arose to reply, he could not say a word. "Sit
down, Mr. Washington," said the speaker, "your modesty

<p>Washington took his young bride to Mount Vernon,
and there began the life that he enjoyed far more than
the life of a soldier. He felt a deep interest in everything
on the plantation. Early every morning he visited his
stables and his kennel, for he liked horses and dogs very
much. He then mounted a spirited horse and rode over
his plantation to look at the growing fields of tobacco
or wheat, or at the work of his slaves.</p>

<p>When the king's inspectors in the West Indies and in

have a head. John Adams arose in Congress and said
that for the place of commander he had "but one gentleman

<p>Washington took his army to New York, and built
a fort on Long Island to protect the city. He was none
too quick, for Howe came with thirty thousand men
and many war ships.</p>

<p>In the battle on Long Island a part of Washington's
army was defeated. General Howe planned to capture
the defeated troops next day, but Washington was too
shrewd. In the night he collected all the boats in that
region and rowed his army over to New York before the
British knew what he was doing.</p>

tried to get

it. But he did
neither, for

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Heroic

<p>While at

Washington felt that he must learn some secrets about
the enemy. Nathan Hale, a young officer, volunteered
to bring General Washington the information he wanted;
but Hale was caught by the British and hanged. "I
only regret," he said, "that I have but one life to lose
for my country."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Washington

<p>Howe then turned back as if to march against Philadelphia
and capture Congress. Washington quickly
threw a part of his army across the Hudson into New
Jersey, but he had to retreat. The British followed in a
hot chase across New Jersey. Washington crossed the
Delaware, and took with him all the boats for many
miles up and down the river. The British decided to
wait till they could cross on the ice. Some of their
generals thought the war was about over, and hastened
back to New York to spend the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p><strong>71. The People Did Not Know Washington.</strong> Those
were, indeed, dark days for the Americans. Hundreds
of Washington's soldiers had gone home discouraged,
and many other faint-hearted Americans thought
the cause lost, and were again promising obedience to
George III. But the people did not yet know Washington.</p>

<p>On Christmas night, with two thousand five hundred
picked men, Washington took to his boats, and crossed
the Delaware in spite of the floating ice. Nine miles
away, in Trenton, lay the Hessians, those soldiers from
Hesse-Cassel, in Europe, whom George III had hired
to fight his American subjects, because Englishmen
refused to fight Americans.</p>

<p>Cornwallis, the British commander, hurried forward

at Trenton. That night Washington's army stole away,
and Cornwallis awoke in the morning to hear the
booming of Washington's cannon at Princeton, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Washington was defeating another part of the British
army. Cornwallis hastened to Princeton. It was too
late. Washington was safe among the
heights of Morristown, where Cornwallis
did not dare attack him.</p>

<p>These two victories turned the tide
and aroused the Americans. Reënforcements
and supplies made Washington's
army stronger and more comfortable.</p>

<p>The next spring (1777) General Howe
decided to capture Philadelphia. But
Washington boldly moved his army
across Howe's line of march. Howe
did not want to fight, so he put his army
on board his ships, sailed around into
the Chesapeake, landed, and marched
for the "rebel capital," as the British called Philadelphia.</p>

<p>At Brandywine Creek, south of Philadelphia, Washington

retreated. In this battle Lafayette, a young French
nobleman, was wounded. Lafayette had heard in France

Philadelphia. Washington took post for the winter at
Valley Forge, on the Schuylkill River, twenty miles
northwest of Philadelphia. There, in the deep woods
among the hills, and in log huts built by their own hands,
the American forces passed a winter so full of suffering
that it makes one shudder to read the story.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What the

<p>When the army marched into Valley Forge, "their
route could be traced on the snow by the blood that
oozed from their bare, frost-bitten feet." Washington
wrote to Congress that nearly three thousand of his men
were "barefoot or otherwise naked."</p>

<p>A part of the army had no bread for three days, and for
two days no meat. Hundreds had no beds, and gladly
slept on piles of straw. Others had no blankets, and sat
up nights before the fire to keep from freezing. Many sickened
and died. But in Philadelphia the well-fed British
soldiers had a gay season, with balls and banquets.</p>

German officer, he
drilled his men.
In the spring when

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Good

<p>Finally, in the summer of 1781,
General Lafayette, who had now
recovered from his wound, and
had fought with the Americans
at Monmouth, was sent to Virginia
by Washington to watch the
British army there. Lafayette
sent Washington word that Cornwallis
had come up from the
Carolinas, and had taken post at
Yorktown. After receiving more
soldiers, Lafayette followed Cornwallis
to Yorktown and stationed
his army near that place. Washington also got word
that a large French war fleet was coming to the coast
of Virginia to aid the Americans. This fleet had been
sent to aid the Americans by the King of France.
Washington also had six thousand fine French troops
under the command of General Rochambeau. This aid
had been secured through the influence of Lafayette, who
had visited his home in France in 1779.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Washington

<p>Washington now saw his chance. He ordered Lafayette
to watch Cornwallis while he himself took two
thousand ragged Continentals and four thousand French
troops in bright uniforms, and slipped away from New
York. He was almost in Philadelphia before the British
or his own soldiers could guess where he was going.</p>

<p>At Yorktown, Washington and his army found both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Lafayette and the French fleet keeping watch. Day
and night the siege went on amid the roar of cannon.
When all was ready, then came the wild charge of the
Americans and the French in the face of British cannon
and over British breastworks. The outer works were
won, and Cornwallis saw that he must surrender. Seven
thousand of the king's troops marched out and gave up
their arms.</p>

with his officers in Fraunces' Tavern, New York, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>

had elected one of Washington's neighbors, Benjamin
Harrison, to be their governor. He missed some old
friends. Some had died on the field of battle; others,
like Lord Fairfax, had gone back to England, where they
could be ruled by George III. Soon visitors began to
come&mdash;old soldiers, beloved generals, and great statesmen
from America, as well as distinguished people from
Europe. They all wanted the honor of visiting the man
who had led the American armies to victory, but who,
again, was only a Virginia planter.</p>


<p><strong>75. Lafayette Visits Washington.</strong> The year after
peace was made Lafayette came back to America to visit
General Washington. There were great times at Mount
Vernon. Washington, Lafayette, and other noble men
sat around the table and there told stories of their
struggles and of their triumphs.</p>

<p>Lafayette visited many other places and received a
warm welcome wherever he went; he had taken active
part in many battles of the Revolution; his blood had
flowed for the American cause. At Monmouth he had
saved the Americans from retreat by sending for Washington.
He had had an important part in the crowning
victory at Yorktown. The Americans loved and admired
him, and did all in their power to show their gratitude.
Many years after, on another visit to America, Congress
voted him two hundred thousand dollars and twenty-four
thousand acres of land as a reward for his great services.</p>

<p><strong>76. Washington Elected First President.</strong> The American
people would not let Washington long enjoy Mount
Vernon, for when they met to make a new constitution,
or plan of government, he was chairman of the meeting,
and when that government was to go into operation they
would have no other man for their first president than
George Washington.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A triumphal

<p>In 1789 he once more bade Mount Vernon and his

which was at that time the capital of the new nation.
What a journey! It was almost one continual procession
and celebration! At every town and roadside the people
came to show their love for Washington, whom they
rightly called the "Father of his Country." School
children scattered flowers in his way and beautiful young
women sang patriotic songs as he passed under decorated
arches. When he reached New York Harbor the bay was
white with the sails of many nations. Crowds thronged
the streets, cannon boomed, and flags were thrown to

and pledged himself to govern the people according to
the Constitution they had just made. He reverently
bent and kissed the Bible, and became the first President
of the United States. From the street, from doors and
windows, and from the housetops, the people cried out:
"Long live George Washington, President of the United
States!"</p>

<p>His new office was almost as hard a task as the Revolution
had been. He was now in charge of the affairs of
the country. He had to see to it that laws were made
to protect the rights of every one. Then he had to see
that these laws were carried out. He could not guide
himself by what another president had done, for there
had been none before him.</p>

his little earnings in buying books. He borrowed books
when he could not buy them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>How he
improved
his
language</strong></div>

<p>Finally Franklin's parents
decided that since he
loved books so well he might
be a printer, and put him
to learn the trade with an
older brother. Benjamin
was to serve his brother for
his board and clothes until
he was twenty-one.
He worked hard at his
trade, and read more
books than before. He
improved his own language
by writing out in
his own words what he had
read, and then comparing his account with the author's.</p>

<p>He now offered to take half the money that his board
cost, and board himself. His brother agreed to this plan,
and Benjamin saved money and bought more books.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Writes
for his
brother's
paper</strong></div>

<p>He longed to write something for his brother's paper.
He did so, and put it at night under the door, but he did
not dare sign his name to what he had written. His
brother showed it to his friends. They praised it, and
it was printed. It was fun for Benjamin to hear people
guessing that the writer must be some great man in Boston.
Franklin wrote several other articles, and called
them the "Dogood Papers," but his brother was angry
when he learned who wrote them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Leaves
home</strong></div>

<p>Franklin was now only seventeen, but because of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
brother's cruelty he sold his books and took a boat for
New York without saying good-by to his parents. He
afterwards said that leaving home in this way was a
great mistake.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>From
New
York to
Philadelphia</strong></div>

<p>No one in New York wanted a printer, so young
Franklin took a boat for Perth-Amboy, New Jersey, on
his way to Philadelphia. His ship was caught in a
storm, and the passengers were wet and hungry when
they landed.</p>

<p>Franklin set out on foot across the state for Burlington.
For nearly three days he walked in the rain along muddy
roads, looking so rough people thought he was a runaway
servant. He was tired and homesick. But he took
boat again, and reached Philadelphia on Sunday morning,
landing at the foot of Market Street.</p>

shirts and stockings, and
a roll of bread under each
arm and one in his hand,
Franklin walked up Market
Street, and passed the
home of his future wife,
Deborah Reed. No wonder
she laughed at him.
She would have laughed
more if some one had
said: "There goes a boy

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Good

<p>Franklin found work in a printing office, saved his
money, and bought books to study. He got acquainted
with other young people who also loved books, and he
often spent his evenings with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A call
from the
governor</strong></div>

<p>To the surprise of Franklin and his brother printers,
one day Sir William Keith, the governor of Pennsylvania,
called at the shop to see Franklin. Governors
did not then pay much attention to poor printers. The
governor, who was dissatisfied with Philadelphia printers,
promised to send him to England to buy a printing
press.</p>

and sisters to see the long-absent son and brother! But
his father could give him no aid, and the young printer
returned to Philadelphia. The
governor, however, promised to
pay his expenses, and Benjamin
took ship for England.</p>

<p>The governor had not even
given him letters of introduction,
to say nothing of money, and
Franklin found himself a stranger
in one of the largest cities in the
world.</p>

<p>The next year a Philadelphia merchant

at his old trade as printer, and in a

<p>Franklin and his young wife kept these rules faithfully.
She worked in the printing office as well as in the house.
They hired no servants: Their furniture, dress, and
food were plain. He ate his breakfast of bread and milk
out of a wooden bowl with a pewter spoon. Mrs. Franklin
surprised him one day by giving him a china bowl and
a silver spoon. She said her husband deserved such
things as well as other men.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Elected

<p>The people of Philadelphia admired Benjamin Franklin
more and more. At the age of thirty he was chosen

was elected a lawmaker in the Assembly. Every year
for ten years his neighbors elected him to help make the

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Franklin

<p>In 1754 Franklin was sent

to meet men from other
colonies to make a treaty
with the Iroquois, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
plan a union of the Thirteen Colonies. While George
Washington was still a surveyor, before Wolfe captured
Quebec, and when Patrick Henry was yet a boy,
Franklin wrote out a plan of union which pointed the
way toward that greater Union, the United States of
America.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Fame

<p>Franklin was now becoming famous outside of Pennsylvania.
Yale College honored him with the degree of
Master of Arts. The old University of Cambridge,
England, gave him the same degree.</p>

<p>All the wise men in England and France were excited
by news of an experiment made by Benjamin Franklin.
He had made electricity by using glass tubes, and he
had seen the lightning flash in the storm cloud. He
decided to prove, if he could, that lightning and electricity
are the same. No one had yet done this.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Proves

<p>He made a kite out of silk, to which he fastened a small
iron rod. Then he tied a hempen string to the kite and
the rod. To the lower end of the string he tied a silken
cord to protect his hand from the electricity. On the
string he tied a key.</p>

<p>One day when the storm clouds came rolling up,
Franklin sent his kite high up among them, while he
waited. Soon the loose fibers on the hempen string
moved. Franklin placed his knuckles close to the key,
and sparks came flying at his hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>More

<p>When the news of this experiment was published some
very wise men smiled; others said it was a trick. The
great universities of Oxford and Edinburgh, however,
gave him the doctor's degree, and societies of wise men
in England, France, and Spain elected him a member.
He was now the most famous American.</p>

<p>When the Stamp Act was passed
the members of Parliament asked
him nearly two hundred questions
about the effects of the Stamp Act
on America. He wrote many letters
to great men, and long articles to
the English newspapers, explaining
how the Stamp Act injured America.
Both England and America rejoiced
when the king and Parliament
repealed the Stamp Act, and Franklin
sent his wife a fine London gown
in honor of the event.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Franklin
and Pitt</strong></div>

<p>For eight years more, while America
was busy opposing the tax on tea, Franklin was in England
trying to get Parliament and the king to give the Americans
better treatment. But it was all in vain. He often
talked with William Pitt, the great friend of America, who
introduced into Parliament a plan for making friends between
the two countries. But the plan was defeated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Hastens

<p>Franklin saw that war would come, and hastened back

battle at Lexington and Concord (1775).</p>

<p>Pennsylvania sent him to the Congress of 1775, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
sitting in Philadelphia, made George Washington general
of the Continental army. Franklin saw that if the

they must unite. So he introduced into Congress a plan
of union, but the other members were not ready for it.</p>

<p>George Washington, as we have seen, was the president

glad to hear Franklin speak, for he was a very wise man.
As he had helped to make, and had signed, the Declaration

he signed it. Many persons did not like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>

the new plan which he did not like, but declared that he

<p><strong>80. The Stamp Act.</strong> The surrender of Quebec and
the fall of New France
caused great rejoicing
among the thirteen colonies.
But the long, hard
war had left both England
and her colonies deeply in

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What the

<p>So the Parliament of England

licenses to marry, all deeds to property, licenses to trade,
newspapers, almanacs, and other pamphlets had to be
printed on stamped paper.
This paper ranged in
value from a few cents
to many dollars.</p>

<p>Leading men in every
one of the thirteen colonies
spoke and wrote
against the Stamp Act.
Of all the men who did
so, Patrick Henry, of Virginia,
was the most eloquent
and fiery. He had
been elected by the people
of his county to go
up to Williamsburg, the
capital of Virginia, to
help make the laws. There were many able men in that
old House of Burgesses, but none of them wished to
take the lead in opposing the king's plan of a stamp tax.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Patrick
Henry

<p>One day young Henry, although a new member,
snatched a blank leaf from a law book and wrote down

Assembly could tax Virginians, and that any one who
asserted the contrary was an enemy of the colony.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Patrick

<p>He backed up these resolutions with a speech that

men almost held their breath while they listened to the
young orator. He closed by declaring that George III
was acting like a tyrant, and that "Caesar had his Brutus,
Charles the First his Cromwell, and George the Third&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
"Treason! treason!" shouted the Speaker of the House.
Waiting a moment till the noise ceased, the orator,
with a calm and steady voice, added, "may profit by
their example. If this be treason, make the most of it."</p>

<p>Henry's resolutions were passed, and were printed in
almost every newspaper in the colonies. They made the
people more determined than ever not to buy stamped
paper.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Patrick

<p><strong>81. The Orator of the Revolution.</strong> Patrick Henry
was born in Virginia (1736). His father was a well-educated
Scotchman, who taught school and became a
lawyer. His mother was of Welsh blood. Young
Patrick went to school, but he liked to hunt and fish far
better than to study. He was a puzzle to his parents.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Early
failures</strong></div>

<p>By the time he was eighteen he had failed as a student,
as a clerk, and as a storekeeper. He then married. The
parents on both sides helped them to start farming with
a few slaves. In two years Patrick Henry was forced
to sell. Once more he tried keeping a country store. In
three years the store closed its doors and Patrick Henry,
aged twenty-three, was without an occupation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Liked to

history
and law</strong></div>

<p>He now turned to the study of law. Although not in
love with school when a boy, he loved to read the Bible.
He also had a strong liking for history, and, in his youth,
read the histories of Greece, of Rome, of England, and
of the colonies. By a few months of hard study of the
law he passed the examination. He succeeded from the
first, and in less than four years had been engaged in more
than one thousand cases.</p>

colony had paid its clergymen from the beginning.
Each one received a certain number of pounds of tobacco
for his salary. But the price was now high and now low.
A dispute arose because of this and was taken into court.
But no great lawyer would take the people's side. Patrick
Henry did. The courthouse was filled with people,
many clergymen among them. In the judge's chair sat
Patrick's own father.</p>

The people began to listen, and then to lean forward
spellbound by the charm of his eloquence and the power
of his argument. The clergy grew angry and left the
room. His father,
forgetting that he
was judge, cried

<p><strong>83. New Taxes.</strong>
As if the king
and Parliament could learn nothing, they passed a Tea
Tax the very next year, placing a tax on all the tea
imported into the
colonies. Then the
Americans everywhere
refused to buy the
tea and pay the tax.
When the tea ships
came to America the
people of New York
and Philadelphia
sent them back, and
the "Sons of Liberty"
at Annapolis burned a ship full of tea. The king's governor
at Boston refused to permit the ships to carry the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>

the tea into the sea. King George grew angry at such
"tea parties," and had laws passed
to punish Boston. More British
soldiers were sent there to force the
people to obey these detested laws.</p>

American."</p>

<p>As Patrick Henry talked with men from other colonies

he was convinced that war must come. He went home

in the old capitol at Williamsburg, so they were held in
St. John's Church, Richmond, a church still standing.</p>

Defends his Resolutions.</strong>
Patrick Henry
listened to the speeches
with smothered excitement.
When he rose to defend his resolutions his face
was pale and his voice was trembling. But soon his
audience forgot what other men had said. They leaned
forward and listened as if no other man had spoken.
He stirred their deepest feelings when he declared:
"We must fight! I repeat it, Sir, we must fight! An
appeal to arms and the God of Hosts is all that is left to
us. They tell us, Sir, that we are weak; unable to cope
with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we
be stronger? Will it be the next week or the next year?
Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of the
means which the God of Nature hath placed in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
power. There is no retreat but in submission and
slavery. Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be
heard on the plains of Boston! The
war is inevitable, and let it come!
I repeat it, Sir: Let it come!&mdash;The
war is actually begun! The next
gale that sweeps from the north will
bring to our ears the clash of resounding
arms. Our brothers are already
in the field! Why stand we here idle! Is life so dear,
or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of
chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know
not what course others may take; but as for me, give
me liberty, or give me death."</p>

by chains, and that his face looked like that of a hopeless
slave. After a solemn pause he raised his eyes and
chained hands toward heaven, and said, as if in prayer:
"Forbid it, Almighty God!" He then slowly bent his
body still nearer the floor, looking
like a man oppressed, heart-broken,
and helpless, and said: "I know not

Then, rising grandly and proudly,
with every muscle strained, as if
he would break his imaginary chains,
he exclaimed: "Give me liberty, or

<p><strong>85. Samuel Adams.</strong> While Patrick Henry was stirring
the feelings of the people by his fiery eloquence,
Samuel Adams was stirring them by strong arguments in
his writings, to oppose the acts of king and of Parliament.</p>

<p><em>From the original painting by John
Singleton Copley, representing Adams

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A
student</strong></div>

<p>Samuel Adams was born in Massachusetts (1722).
While he loved school and books he cared very little for
spending his time in outdoor amusements. At eighteen
Samuel was graduated from Harvard College. His
parents hoped that he would be a minister, but he began
to study law. His mother was so opposed to his becoming
a lawyer that he gave up the
study and turned to business.
He set up in business for himself,
but, like Patrick Henry, soon lost
all. He next went into business
with his father, but in that, too,
he failed. Finally Samuel Adams
turned to politics.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Early
love for
politics</strong></div>

<p>While a student in Harvard
he had debated the question
whether it was right to resist
the king to save the country
from ruin. He took an active
part in debating clubs and very
soon began to write for the newspapers,
encouraging resistance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
He never hesitated to take what he thought the right
side of any question.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Why
Adams
opposed
the
Stamp
Act</strong></div>

<p>Speaking before a meeting of Boston people, Samuel
Adams boldly declared that if England could tax the
business of the colonies, then, "why not tax our lands
and everything we possess or make use of?" Such
taxes, he said, would make the colonists slaves.</p>

<p>In a short time the people of Boston were reading in
the papers the fiery resolutions and the still more fiery
speech of Patrick Henry. Samuel Adams seized his
pen and also began to pour hot shot into the Stamp Act.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>How he
opposed
the
Stamp
Act</strong></div>

<p>The Boston people elected him to be their representative
in the Massachusetts Assembly. More and more
he took the lead in the movement against the Stamp Act.
He went about the shops, into the stores, wherever he
found people to listen to him.</p>

<p>He helped them form a society, called the Sons of
Liberty, which destroyed the hated stamps as soon as
they arrived. He talked with the merchants, and they
signed a pledge not to buy any more goods from England
until the Stamp Act was repealed. At this the British
merchants felt the loss of trade and joined in the cry
against the Stamp Act.</p>


<p><strong>86. The Tea Tax.</strong> We have seen that Parliament,
after the Stamp Act was repealed, passed the famous
Tea Act. The Americans were angry again, and the
Sons of Liberty declared that no tea should be landed.
The merchants took the pledge again to buy no more
English goods, and patriotic women began to make tea
out of the leaves of other plants.</p>

CIRCULAR LETTER</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Samuel

the "Circular
Letter"</strong></div>

<p>Samuel Adams again sharpened his pen, and wrote
the famous old "Circular Letter," which urged all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
colonies to unite and stand firm in opposing the tax on
tea. This letter made King George very angry, but
Samuel Adams only wrote
the more.</p>

<p>Night after night as
the people passed his
window they saw by his
lamp that he was busy
with his pen, and said
to one another: "Samuel
Adams is hard at work
writing against the Tories."
People in England
and America who took
the king's side in these disputes
were called Tories.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Conflicts
between
people
and
soldiers</strong></div>

<p>The king now sent two
regiments of soldiers to Boston to force the people to
pay the Tea Tax. There were frequent quarrels between
the soldiers and the people. One evening in a street
quarrel the soldiers killed three men and wounded eight
others (1770). Immediately the fire bells rang and
great crowds of angry people filled the streets. The
next day they filled to overflowing Faneuil Hall, the
"Cradle of Liberty." A still larger meeting in the Old
South Church cried out that both regiments of soldiers
must leave town.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Samuel
Adams

<p>Adams and other leaders were sent to the king's officers
to tell them what the people had said. Before the
governor and the general, backed by the king's authority
and by two regiments, stood plain Samuel Adams, with
only the voice of the people to help him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>The governor, unwilling to obey the demand of the
people, said he would send one regiment away. But
Samuel Adams stood firm, and said: "Both regiments
or none!" The governor finally gave up, and Samuel
Adams, the man of the people, was a greater leader than
ever before.</p>

<p>The king now tried to trick the Americans into paying
the tax by making tea cheaper in America than in England,
but leaving on the tax. But the people everywhere
declared that they did not object to the price, but to
the tax.</p>

speech. Other leaders spoke. One stirred the audience
by asking "how tea would mix with salt water." Evening

vessels returned and said the governor would not give

brought up the boxes of tea, broke them open, and threw
the tea into the sea.</p>

with letters to the leaders in other colonies in his saddlebags,
Paul Revere, the great courier of the Revolution,
started on his long ride to New York and Philadelphia.
As he went from town to town and told the story of the
Tea Party the people cheered him, spread dinners for
him, built bonfires, and fired cannon. He saw thousands
of people gather in New York and Philadelphia, and
heard them declare that they would stand by Boston.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Boston

<p>Boston soon needed help, for the king and Parliament

sent to Boston to force the people to obey them.</p>


<p><strong>88. The First Continental Congress.</strong> We have seen

in it were a suit of clothes, two
pairs of shoes, silver shoe buckles,
gold knee buckles, a cocked hat,
a gold-headed cane, and a fashionable
red cloak. What proof
of the people's love for their

driven the king's regiments out of Boston, who had
planned the Tea Party, and whom the king could not
bribe. Here, in Carpenter's Hall, for the first time, he

Henry Lee, of Virginia, Christopher Gadsden, who was
called the "Samuel Adams of South Carolina," and many
other noble men who became his life-long friends.</p>

the church bells. He knew the country was rising.</p>

<p>At Lexington minutemen who guarded the house

<p><strong>90. The Battle at Lexington and at Concord Bridge.</strong>
As the British soldiers reached Lexington at sunrise,
April 19, 1775, the captain of the minutemen gave the
command: "Stand your ground. Don't fire unless fired
upon. But if they mean to have war, let it begin here!"
A bold speech for a captain of only about sixty men
when facing as brave soldiers as Europe had ever seen!
The minutemen stood their ground till seven were killed
and nine wounded&mdash;nearly one third of their number.
Then they retreated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

<p>The British pushed on to Concord. But the minutemen,
now coming from every direction, made a stand at
Concord Bridge. Their musket fire was so deadly that
the British started back, running at times to escape with
their lives. At Lexington they fell upon the ground,
tired out with the chase the minutemen gave them, and
were met by fresh troops from Boston.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Many

<p>Soon the British soldiers were forced to run again, for
minutemen by hundreds were gathering, and they
seldom missed their aim. From behind rocks, trees,
fences, and houses they cut down the tired redcoats.
Nearly three hundred British soldiers were killed or
wounded before Boston was reached that night.</p>

<p><strong>91. The Battle of Bunker Hill.</strong> Day and night for
weeks minutemen from other New England colonies,
and even from as far south as Virginia, marched in hot
haste to Boston. The British general soon found his
army in Boston entirely cut off from the mainland. He
resolved to fortify Bunker Hill, but what was his surprise
to wake one morning (June 17) and find the Americans
under Colonel Prescott already building breastworks on
the hill.</p>

<p>That afternoon three thousand picked troops, in solid

minutemen. On came the lines of red, with banners

ran a flame of fire which mowed the redcoats down like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>

Again they charged; again they broke and ran. They
were brave men, and, although hundreds of their companions
had fallen, a third time the British charged, and
won, for the Americans had used up their powder, and
they had no bayonets. More than one thousand British
soldiers fell that day. The Americans did not lose half
that number. But among the killed was brave General
Joseph Warren.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Hale

<p><strong>94. Nathan Hale, the Martyred Patriot.</strong> Nathan
Hale was born in Connecticut in 1755. He was brought
up by his Puritan parents in the fear of God and in
obedience to duty. At the age of sixteen Nathan left his
native farm to enter Yale University. Here he soon
became well liked for his gentle nature, lively spirit,
and studious habits. In spite of his youth he was a
leader in the affairs of his class and in all athletic sports.
He graduated from college with honor and then taught
school for almost two years. These were quiet days
for the active young man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Enrolled
to

for
liberty</strong></div>

<p>At this time the people were talking a great deal about
their troubles with Great Britain. In secret, bands of
young men were even forming companies of militia.
Suddenly the news of the fight at Lexington came to the
place where Nathan Hale was teaching. The citizens
gathered in meeting and he made a speech, in which he
said: "Let us march immediately and never lay down
our arms until we obtain our independence." The next
day he and many others enrolled to fight for liberty.</p>

</div>

<p>Washington was in command of the Continental army at
Boston and soon sent for Hale's company. None worked
harder than he at drills, or
did more to keep the men
cheerful in hardships. On
New Year's day, 1776, Congress
made him captain for
his bravery and faithfulness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Captures

<p>In the following spring
Washington moved his
army to New York. One
night Nathan Hale and a
small band of men slipped
out into the harbor where
a British sloop lay. They
boarded the ship gently,
locked the sailors in before
they knew what had happened,
then they sailed their
prize past a British man-of-war
and over to the American
side. It was a brave
feat, well carried out.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Offers

<p>Soon after, the American troops were badly defeated
in the battle of Long Island. The army was half starved
and losing hope. The British general, Howe, was preparing
to attack again. If Howe should win, the American
cause would be lost. Washington saw that it was necessary
to find out the British plans, or he would be
caught and his army destroyed. A brave man was
needed to go into the British camp to spy out their plans.
No one was willing to go. Hale had been sick, but when
he heard of his country's need he offered himself. Friends
pleaded with him in vain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Passes

<p>The young officer took off his uniform and put on the
clothes of a schoolmaster. Under cover of night he was
rowed to a place near the British camp. This was the
last his friends saw of him. He spent several days with
the British troops and got the needed information. On
his return he passed safely through the whole British army.
He went to the spot where the boat was to come for him.
There he waited until the boat came into view and then
walked down to the water's edge to meet it. A dozen
muskets were leveled at him; instead of fellow-soldiers he
found himself in the hands of the British!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Hale

to death</strong></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Gives
his life

country</strong></div>

<p>Hale was sent to New York immediately and placed
before General Howe, to whom he said frankly that he
was a spy. The British general wrote out his death
warrant, "to be hanged to-morrow morning at sunrise."
Not even the death of a soldier was to be his. His
brutal guard refused to let him send a last letter to his
people. Alone he spent the night, without the comfort
of friend or minister. At daybreak he was dragged
forth to execution. A crowd of strange people had
gathered to see him die. It is said that the officer asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
him if there was anything he wished to say. Brave to
the last, Nathan Hale answered: "I only regret that I
have but one life to lose for my country." Thus, at the
age of twenty-two, died Nathan Hale, who held his
country dearer than his own life.</p>

of hard fighting, retired to his home, "Soldiers' Rest,"
in the Shenandoah Valley. After the war was over his
neighbors elected him to Congress, where he gave hearty
support to President Washington.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A touching
scene</strong></div>

<p>When Daniel Morgan died he was followed to the
grave by the largest procession that the valley had yet
seen. The people, who had come from near and far,
witnessed a touching sight. They saw seven gray-haired
veterans, with old rifles in their hands, stand beside
the grave of the hero, and fire a military salute. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
were the last of that hardy band of ninety-six which had
marched with Morgan to Boston to join Washington,
nearly thirty years before. This was their last military
farewell!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Greene's
"victory"</strong></div>


<p><strong>98. The Battle of Guilford Court House.</strong> General
Greene won a great victory by retreating. He and his
army were still among friends, and his army was growing.
Cornwallis was hundreds of miles from his supplies and
from reënforcements. After a few weeks, Greene crossed
back into North Carolina and fiercely attacked Cornwallis
at Guilford Court House, and killed or wounded one
fourth of his army.</p>

<p>Cornwallis claimed the victory, but instead of attacking
Greene he marched his army rapidly to Wilmington,
on the seacoast, and from there marched into Virginia,
where Washington and Lafayette caught him in a trap
at Yorktown.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Greene

<p>Greene turned back to South Carolina, where the

British lost so many men at Hobkirks Hill and at Eutaw
Springs, their last important battles in the South, that
they were compelled to retreat to Charleston, where
they were when the news from Yorktown put an end to
serious fighting.</p>

<p>General Greene's work as a soldier was done. Besides
the medal presented to him by Congress for the battle of
Eutaw Springs, South Carolina, as a token of affection,
gave him a large sum of money, and the state of Georgia
a beautiful plantation on the Savannah River, where
he died in 1786. Greene's fame as a soldier of the

<p><strong>99. Francis Marion.</strong> Of all the brave men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
helped Greene win back the South, none was braver
than General Francis Marion, whom the British named
the "Swamp Fox." Marion was born in the same year
as Washington. He was of French parentage. He was
so very small in size that people wondered how he could
be so great a soldier.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Marion's
"Brigade"</strong></div>

<p>Marion's "Brigade," as his company was called, was
made up of only a handful of men, usually less than one
hundred. But they owned and rode the swiftest horses,
carried their own guns, and wore their own swords,
hammered out of old saws by country blacksmiths.</p>

</div>

<p>Marion and his men seldom were two successive nights
in the same place. The night was their time for work.
At sundown they swung into their saddles, and were soon
riding for the enemy's camp. When near, they quietly
surrounded the camp, took aim by the light of the fires,
fired, and then rushed upon the frightened British or
Tories, and cut them down
with their terrible broadswords.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>How
they
escaped</strong></div>

<p>Before daybreak, Marion
and his men were hiding
safely in some distant swamp
or other safe place. If the
British chased him too closely
his men scattered in different
directions, but always made
their way to the common hiding
place. In a few days they
were ready to strike again.</p>

Marion pounced upon a guard of British soldiers that
was taking one hundred fifty prisoners to Charleston,
captured them all, and set
the prisoners free.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Tarleton

<p>At last Cornwallis ordered
Colonel Tarleton
to get "Mr. Marion," as
he called him. But before
Tarleton could act
Marion had fallen on a
large party of Tories going
to join Cornwallis, and
killed, captured, or scattered
the entire party. Tarleton chased Marion for
twenty-five miles, only to find a large swamp through
which he could see neither road nor path. He gave up
the chase in disgust, declaring he would pursue the
"Swamp Fox" no farther.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Congress
gives
Marion a
vote of
thanks</strong></div>

<p>When Greene returned to the last campaign in South
Carolina he found no better, bolder, or more vigilant
helpers than Marion and his "Brigade." Greene gave
Marion high praise, and Congress gave him a vote of
thanks.</p>

<p>Marion was the true soldier of liberty. He cared
nothing for display, only for the success of the patriot
cause. Marion thought of his men before himself. He
was watchful, patient, and silent. He always struck
his foes where and when they did not look for him. If
they were too strong for him he vanished like smoke in
a brisk breeze.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>After
the war</strong></div>

<p>Marion was as true and gentle as he was bold and brave.
He was never cruel to prisoners, and was greatly opposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
to punishing the Tories after the war was over. Marion's
neighbors often elected him to high office and in many
other ways showed that they admired him, even if some
did not agree with him.</p>

VICTORY IN THE FRENCH SHIP, "BON HOMME RICHARD"</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>John
Paul
born in
Scotland</strong></div>


<p><strong>100. John Paul.</strong> In 1747, in far-away Scotland, on
the arm of the sea called Solway Firth, a great sailor
was born. John Paul played along the seashore, saw
tall ships, and heard wonderful stories of a new land
called America, whose ships filled with tobacco came into
the firth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Sails on
the
"Friendship"
to
America</strong></div>

<p>John Paul did not get much schooling, and at the age
of thirteen he went as a sailor lad on the <em>Friendship</em> to
America. The ship sailed into Chesapeake Bay and up
the Rappahannock River to the town of Fredericksburg,
where he found his brother William living on a plantation.
In the very same town where George Washington had
just been to school, John Paul also went to school. He
studied hard to make up for lost time, and left a great
name among the boys.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Returns
and sails
for Africa</strong></div>

<p>He afterward returned to Scotland, and at the age of
nineteen sailed as an officer on a slave-trading ship to
Africa, and carried a load of negroes away from their
native land. Many people did not then think it wrong
to do this, but John Paul hated the cruel business, and
left the slave ship as soon as he reached Jamaica.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Made
captain</strong></div>

<p>On his way back to Scotland the officers of the ship
died, and John Paul, although but twenty years old, had
to take charge. The owners of the vessel were so pleased
with the way he handled it that they made him captain,
and he went on many voyages to different countries.</p>

Virginia he watched the quarrel between England and

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Offers

<p><strong>101. John Paul Jones
Enters the American
Navy.</strong> He hastened to
Philadelphia and offered
his services to Congress.
He knew England would
send thousands of soldiers
to America; and that she
would send her war ships
along our seacoasts and
up and down our bays
and rivers, to capture and
burn our towns. He also
knew that the Congress
did not own a single war
ship when the war began.</p>

<p>Congress ordered war ships to be built. While these
were being made, Congress ordered trading vessels to be
fitted with cannon and sent out to capture British ships.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Changes
his name</strong></div>

<p>When John Paul went to Philadelphia he gave his name
as Paul Jones, probably in honor of Willie Jones, a friend
who lived in North Carolina. Some have thought that
he did not want the British to know him, if they should
capture him in a sea fight.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What he
could do</strong></div>

<p>Although Paul Jones really knew more about war ships
than most of the men in Philadelphia, Congress gave him
a very low office. But that made no difference to him,
for he really wanted to get into a sea fight. In 1775 he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
was made a lieutenant, and joined an expedition to
capture cannon and powder from the British in the
West Indies. He did so well
that Congress made him
captain and gave him a ship.
He then went on a cruise to
the West Indies, where in six
weeks he captured sixteen
prizes and destroyed a number
of small vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Sent to
France</strong></div>

<p>Congress afterward gave
him command of the ship
<em>Ranger</em>, and sent him to
carry letters to Benjamin
Franklin, who was in France
trying to get the king to take sides with the Americans.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>With the
"Ranger"
at
Whitehaven</strong></div>

<p>Franklin planned for Jones to take the <em>Ranger</em> to
the coast of England, and show that American as well as
English ships could burn, destroy, and fight. He captured
two vessels, made straight for his old town of
Whitehaven, "spiked" the cannon in the fort, set some
ships on fire, and escaped without harm.</p>

<p>Near by this place, his sailors took all the silver from
the home of a rich lady. This robbery troubled him so
much that, afterward, at great expense to himself, he
returned the silver to its owner.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>"Paul,
the
Pirate"</strong></div>

<p>"Look out for Paul Jones, the pirate!" the people said;
and the <em>Drake</em>, carrying two more cannon than the
<em>Ranger</em>, was sent to capture her. Five boatloads of
people went to see the pirate captured. The fight
lasted more than an hour. When the <em>Drake</em> surrendered,
her captain and forty-two men had been killed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
The <em>Ranger</em> had lost only two men. After this fight the
English towns were still more afraid of Paul Jones.</p>

<p>There was great joy in France when
Paul Jones sailed into port. The king,
who was now making war on England,
promised him a larger fleet of war vessels.
So, in 1779, he found himself captain
of a large ship armed with fifty
cannon. He called the ship the <em>Bon
Homme Richard</em> in honor of Franklin's
Almanac, the "Poor Richard." Three
smaller vessels joined him, and he again
set sail for the English coast. The

<p><strong>102. A Great Sea Fight and a

coasts he captured many trading ships and frightened the
people. At last he came upon two British war ships. Just
at dark the <em>Richard</em> attacked a larger English ship, the
<em>Serapis</em>. At the first fire two of Jones' cannon burst,
tearing up the deck and killing a dozen of his own men.</p>

<p>The fight went on for an hour, when the <em>Serapis</em>
came near, and Jones ran the <em>Richard</em> into her. "Have
you struck your colors?" called out the
English captain. "I have not yet begun
to fight!" replied Captain Jones.
When the ships came together again
Paul Jones himself seized a great rope
and tied them together. Now the fighting
was terrific. The cannon tore huge
holes in the sides of the ships.</p>

<p>Only a few cannon

English captain surrendered.</p>

in the eyes of the French people, and in the eyes of the
Americans, too.</p>

<p>After the war Paul Jones was an officer in the Russian

still young he was put to service on board a merchant
ship. Here young Barry learned more than being a mere

and met and captured the <em>Edward</em>

the <em>Lexington</em> was the first
ship to bear the American flag
to victory.</p>

<p>Congress, pleased with the
result, put him in charge of a
larger ship, called the <em>Effingham</em>.
The British, however, bottled

threw down their arms and ran below. Barry fastened
down the hatchways, and then turned his attention to the
four transports, which quickly surrendered. Barry then
took his five prizes across the river to an American fort.</p>

<p>Boone's parents moved to North Carolina, and settled

age of twenty, and, pioneer-like, moved farther into the
forest, where people were scarcer and game more plentiful.
He built a log cabin for his bride, and made a "clearing"

furnished their table with all kinds of wild meat, such as
bear, deer, squirrel, and turkey.</p>

<p>When the road

Boone built Fort
Boonesboro. The
fort was about two
hundred sixty feet
long, and one hundred
fifty feet wide.
At each corner of
it stood a two-story
blockhouse with loopholes, through which the settlers
could shoot at Indians. Cabins with loopholes were
built along the sides of the fort. Between the cabins
a high fence was made by sinking log posts into the
ground. Two heavy gates were built on opposite sides
of the fort. Every night the horses and cattle were
driven inside the fort.</p>

Some of the bolder settlers built cabins outside of the
fort, where they cut away and burned the trees to raise
corn and vegetables.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Three

<p>To the Indian all this seemed to threaten his hunting

near the shore opposite the fort when the Indians suddenly

crossing the river.</p>

came upon the Indians building a fire, and fired before
they were seen. Two of the Indians fell, and the others
ran away, leaving the girls behind, unharmed, but

<p>The War of the Revolution was already raging east
of the mountains, and the Indians were taking the side
of the British.
In April, 1777,
a small army of
Indians crossed
the Ohio and attacked
Boonesboro.
The little
fort made a bold
fight. The Indians
retreated,
but returned on
the Fourth of
July in large
numbers, to destroy
the fort and scalp the settlers. For two days
and nights the battle went on. The fierce war cry of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>

took deadly aim. The women aided by melting lead into
bullets. The Indians again failed, and finally retreated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

<p>While making salt at the "Blue Licks," Boone and
twenty-seven of his men were captured by the Indians
and marched all the way to Detroit, the headquarters
of the British army in the Northwest. The British
offered the Indians five hundred dollars for Boone, but
the savages were too proud of their great prisoner, and
marched him back to their towns in what is now Ohio.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Adopted

<p>Here he was adopted by an Indian chief. They plucked
out all of Boone's hair except a "scalp lock," which they
ornamented with feathers. They painted and dressed
him like an Indian. His new parents were quite proud
of their son. Sometimes he went hunting alone, but the
Indians counted his bullets and measured his powder.
But Boone was too shrewd for them. He cut the bullets
in two, and used half charges of powder.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Steals

<p>One day he saw four hundred fifty painted warriors
getting ready to march against Boonesboro. He went

excitement in that Indian town! Soon the woods were
full of Indians hunting for Boone. In five days&mdash;with
but one meal&mdash;he reached Boonesboro.</p>

<p>All hands fell to repairing the fort. The horses,
cattle, and provisions were brought inside the fort, and
water was brought from the river.</p>

<p>The Indians came, and Boone's Indian "father"
called on him to surrender. Boone asked for two days
to think about it, but he used this time in getting ready
to fight. At the end of the two days Boone told him
that his men would fight to the last.</p>

Missouri. There he lived and hunted. He saw this
region pass from Spain to France, and from France to

eighty-two, and saw Missouri preparing to enter the
Union as the twenty-fourth state.</p>

in the Shenandoah Valley in 1745. His mother taught
him to read, but he obtained most of his schooling in Washington's
old school town, Fredericksburg. He quit school
at sixteen. He built a storehouse on the Shenandoah and
called it Newmarket. He lived there, selling goods and
fighting Indians, until, at the early age of twenty-six, he
was a wealthy man. He had already made such a name
as an Indian fighter that the governor made him captain in
the militia of which George Washington was then colonel.</p>

<p>Sevier was a fine-looking man. He was tall, slender,

<p>During the Revolutionary War, British agents went
among the Cherokee Indians and gave them guns and
ammunition. Indian-like, they planned to take Fort
Watauga by surprise. They came creeping up to the
fort one morning just at daybreak. Forty deadly rifles
suddenly blazed from
portholes and drove them
back to the woods. During
the siege of three
weeks, food grew scarce
at the fort, and the men
became tired of being
cooped up so long.

out and were shot or
had very narrow escapes

Kate Sherrill. One day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
she ventured out of the fort. It was a daring act, for
four men had lost their lives in this way. The Indians
tried to catch the
girl, for they did
not want to kill
her. But she could
run like a deer, and
almost flew to the
fort. Sevier was
watching, and shot
the Indian nearest
her. The gate was
closed, but she
jumped with all her might, seized the top of the stockade,
drew herself up, and sprang over into the arms of
Sevier. Not long after she became his wife.</p>

<p>In 1778 Sevier heard that the Indians were coming
again. He quickly called his men together, took boats,

towns. He burned the towns, captured their store of
hides, and marched home on foot. How surprised the
Indians were when they returned!</p>

<p><strong>110. Nolichucky Jack.</strong> The Watauga Settlement
was growing in numbers, and Sevier went to live on the
Nolichucky, a branch of the French Broad River. There
he built a large log house, or rather two houses, and
joined them by a covered porch. Outside were large
verandas, while inside were great stone fireplaces.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Welcomes

partook of his cider, hominy, corn bread, and of wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>

their families to a barbecue. Whether people came for
advice or to call him to arms against the Indians, no one
was turned away. "Nolichucky Jack," as his neighbors
loved to call him, held a warm place in every settler's heart.</p>

<p>In 1780 Cornwallis, then victorious in South Carolina,

Ferguson grew bold, and sent word across the
mountains, threatening to punish Sevier and his brave
riflemen. This was enough. Colonel Shelby of Kentucky
and Sevier resolved to rouse the frontiersmen,
cross the mountains, and teach Colonel Ferguson a lesson.
Colonel Campbell with his men from the Holston, in
Virginia, joined them. A thousand well-mounted backwoodsmen,
with their long rifles, fringed hunting shirts,
and coonskin caps, began the march from the Watauga
across the mountains. Once across they were joined
by several hundred Carolinians. Ferguson retreated to
Kings Mountain, too steep on one side to be climbed.
He felt safe behind his thousand gleaming bayonets.</p>

although among themselves there was not a bayonet.
Three divisions, one for each side, marched up the mountain.
Down the mountain side came the flashing bayonets.
The backwoodsmen in the center retreated from
tree to tree, firing steadily all the time. The British,
now shot at from both sides as well as in front, turned
and charged at one side. Then one division fired into
their backs and the other on their side. What could

<p>The backwoodsmen kept to the trees and their rifles seldom
missed their aim. The British retreated to the top
of the mountain. Colonel Ferguson was killed and his
entire army was killed or captured. This victory caused
great rejoicing among the Americans and prepared the
way for the work of Greene and Morgan.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A deadly

<p>Sevier and Campbell hastened back over the mountains,
for the Indians were scalping and burning again. With
seven hundred riflemen, they marched against the Indian
towns and burned a thousand cabins and fifty thousand
bushels of corn. This was a hard blow, but the Indians
kept fighting several years longer.</p>

<p>Sevier, in all, fought thirty-five battles. He was the
most famous Indian fighter of his time.</p>

<h3>GEORGE ROGERS CLARK, THE HERO OF VINCENNES</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Clark

Virginia</strong></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A
surveyor</strong></div>


<p><strong>111. A Successful Leader against the Indians and
the British.</strong> George Rogers Clark was born in Virginia
in 1752. From childhood Clark liked to roam the woods.
He became a surveyor and an Indian fighter at the age
of twenty-one. Like Washington, with chain and compass,
and with ax and rifle, he made his way far into
the wild and lonely forests of the upper Ohio.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A scout</strong></div>

<p>Clark was a
scout for the governor
of Virginia
in the expedition
which defeated
the great Shawnee
chief Cornstalk
at the mouth
of the Kanawha.</p>

<p>Two years later
Clark made his
way alone over the
mountains and
became a leader
in Kentucky, along with Boone. The Kentucky hunters
chose Clark to go to Virginia as their lawmaker.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>In Kentucky</strong></div>

<p>He told Governor Patrick Henry that if Kentucky
was not worth defending against the Indians, it was not
worth having. At this
the Virginian lawmakers
made Kentucky into a
Virginia county and gave
Clark five hundred pounds
of powder, which he carried
down the Ohio River
to Kentucky.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Life at
Harrodsburg</strong></div>

<p>Clark lived at Harrodsburg
where, for more than
a year, he was kept busy
helping the settlers fight
off the Indians. This was
the very time when Boonesboro
and other settlements
were so often surrounded
by Indians who had been
aroused by the British officers at Detroit. These officers
paid a certain sum for each scalp of an American the
Indians brought them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Turns to
Patrick
Henry in
time of
need</strong></div>

<p>After having seen brave men and women scalped by
the Indians, Clark decided to strike a blow at the British
across the Ohio. But where could he find money and
men for an army? Kentucky did not have men enough.
Clark thought of that noble patriot across the mountains,
Patrick Henry. He mounted his horse and guided some
settlers back to Virginia, but kept his secret. In Virginia
he heard the good news that Burgoyne had surrendered.</p>

<p>Governor Henry was heart and soul for Clark's plan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
He made Clark a colonel, gave him six thousand dollars
in paper money, and ordered him to raise an army to
defend Kentucky.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A colonel

<p><strong>112. The Campaign against Old Vincennes.</strong> In
May, 1778, Clark's little army of about one hundred
fifty backwoodsmen, with several families, took their
flatboats and floated down the Monongahela to Fort
Pitt. Clark did not dare tell the riflemen where they
were going, for fear the British might get the word. Here
they took on supplies and a few small cannon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Floating
down the
beautiful
Ohio</strong></div>

<p>On they floated, in the middle of the river to keep away
from the Indians who might be hiding in the deep, dark
forests on the river banks. At the falls of the Ohio, on
Corn Island, Clark landed his party. He built a blockhouse
and cabins, and drilled the riflemen into soldiers
while the settlers planted corn. This was the beginning
of the city of Louisville.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Clark
tells his
secret</strong></div>

<p>One day Clark called his men together and told them
the secret&mdash;he was really leading them against the British
forts on the Illinois and the Wabash rivers.</p>

<p>A few of the men refused to go so far from home&mdash;a
thousand miles&mdash;but the rest were willing to follow their
leader.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A long
march
begun</strong></div>

<p>In June, Clark's boats "shot the falls" and were soon
at the mouth of the Tennessee, where a band of hunters
joined the party. There Clark hid the boats and began
the long march through tangled forests and over grand
prairies. But they did not know what minute the
Indians might attack, or some British scout discover
them and carry the news to General Hamilton at Detroit.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Kaskaskia,
July
4, 1778</strong></div>

<p>They reached the old French town of Kaskaskia at
dusk on July 4. They did not dare give a shout or fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
a gun, for the British officer had more men than Clark.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Surrounds
the town</strong></div>

<p>Clark sent part of his men silently to surround the
town, while he led the others to the fort, where they
heard the merry music of the violin and the voices of
the dancers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
French

<p>Clark himself slipped into the great hall, folded his
arms, and looked in silence on the dimly lighted scene.
An Indian lying on the floor saw Clark's face by the
light of the torches. He sprang to his feet, and gave
the terrible war whoop. Instantly the dancing ceased,
the women screamed, and the men rushed toward Clark.
But Clark simply said: "Go on with your dance, but
remember that you dance under Virginia and not under
Great Britain!" The British general surrendered, and
the French inhabitants trembled, when they learned
that the backwoodsmen had captured the town. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
sent their priest, Father Gibault, and other chief men to
beg for their lives. Imagine their surprise and joy when
Clark told them that not only were their lives safe, but
that the new republic made war on no church, and
protected all from insult.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
treaty
with
France</strong></div>

<p>He also told them that the King of France had made
a treaty with the United States and was sending his
great war ships and soldiers to help America. The
town of Cahokia also surrendered.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Vincennes
surrenders</strong></div>

<p>Father Gibault went to Vincennes to tell the French
settlers about the doings of Clark and to give them the
news that France had taken sides with the Americans.
The people rejoiced, and ran up the American flag. Clark
sent Captain Helm to command the fort.</p>

<p>General Hamilton at Detroit was busy planning to
attack Fort Pitt and to encourage the Ohio Indians to
kill and scalp Kentuckians.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>General
Hamilton
stirred up</strong></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Stays in
Vincennes
until
spring</strong></div>

<p>How astonished he was when he heard that the forts
on the Illinois and the Wabash had fallen! He gathered
a mixed army of British, Canadians, and Indians, crossed
Lake Erie to the mouth of the Maumee, and "poled"
and paddled up that river to the portage. Down the
Wabash they floated, five hundred strong. Vincennes
surrendered without a blow. Hamilton decided to stay
there for the winter and march against Clark in the
spring. This was a blunder. He did not yet know
Clark and his backwoodsmen.</p>

<p>"I must take Hamilton or Hamilton will take me,"
said Clark, when he heard the news. He immediately
set to work to build a rude sort of gunboat, which he
fitted out with his cannon and about forty men. He
sent the <em>Willing</em>, as it was called, down the Mississippi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
around into the Ohio, and up the Wabash to meet him
at Vincennes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Clark

<p>All was excitement in the French towns. Forty or
fifty French joined Clark's riflemen. Father Gibault
gave them his blessing, and the march overland to Vincennes
began.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>On the

<p>Clark divided his men into parties. Each, in its turn,
did the hunting, and at night invited the others to sit
around great camp fires to feast on "bear ham, buffalo
hump, elk saddle, and venison haunch." They ate,
sang, danced, and told stories. No doubt they often
talked of their loved ones far away in the cabins of
Virginia and Kentucky.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
drowned
lands</strong></div>

<p>On they pushed till they came to the "drowned lands
of the Wabash," and there they saw miles and miles
of muddy water. They made a rude boat to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
them over the deepest parts. The horses had to swim.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

gun</strong></div>

<p>Soon they were near enough Vincennes to hear the
"morning gun" at the fort,
but they did not dare fire a
gun themselves for fear of
being discovered by parties
of hunters. Food grew scarce,
game was hard to find, and
starvation threatened them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Terrible
suffering</strong></div>

<p>Sometimes, after wading all
day, they could hardly find a
dry spot to camp for the night.
Some grew too weak to wade
and were carried in boats. The
stronger sang songs to keep
up the courage of the weak.
When they finally reached
the opposite shore of the Wabash
many fell, worn out&mdash;some
lying partly in the water.</p>

<p>Those who were well built great fires and warmed and
fed the faint ones on hot deer broth. But these brave
men soon forgot their hardships and again were full of fight.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Clark's
letter</strong></div>

<p>Clark now decided to take a bold course. He sent a
letter to the people of Vincennes telling them that he
was about to attack the town. He advised all friends
of America to remain quietly in their homes, and asked
all friends of the British to go to the fort and join the
"hair buyer," as the backwoodsmen called Hamilton.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
attack</strong></div>

<p>At dark, Clark's men charged into the town and
attacked the fort. The fight went on all night. As
soon as it was daylight the backwoodsmen fired through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the portholes and drove the gunners from the cannon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Hamilton
surrenders</strong></div>

<p>Clark's men begged to storm the fort. Only one
American had been wounded, but several British soldiers
had been killed and others wounded. In the afternoon
Hamilton surrendered and once more the Stars and
Stripes floated over "old Vincennes."</p>

<p>The <em>Willing</em> appeared in a few days. Her men
were deeply disappointed because they were too late
to take part in the fight.</p>

as once he had planned to do.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Clark's

<p>Virginia rewarded the brave men who had followed
Clark by giving to each three hundred acres of land in
southern Indiana. The land was surveyed and is known
to-day as "Clark's Grant."</p>

<p>Clark and his men had performed one of the greatest
deeds of the Revolutionary War. They made it possible
for the United States to have the Mississippi River for
her western boundary when England acknowledged our
independence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Clark
unrewarded</strong></div>

<p>George Rogers Clark was never properly rewarded.
He spent his last days in poverty at the falls of the
Ohio, on Corn Island, and died in 1818. In 1895 a
monument was erected in honor of his memory in the
city of Indianapolis, Indiana.</p>

<p><strong>113. What a Boy's Love of Tools Led to.</strong> Before
the Revolution there lived in a Massachusetts village
a boy named Eli Whitney. His father had a farm, on
which there was also a tool shop. This was the most
wonderful place in the world to young Eli. Whenever he
had a moment to spare, he was sure to be working away
with his father's lathe or cabinet tools. At the age of
twelve he made a good violin. After that people with
broken violins came to him to have them mended.</p>

<p>One day, when his father had gone to church, Eli got
Mr. Whitney's fine watch and took it all apart. He
then showed his wonderful mechanical ability by putting
it together again, and it ran as smoothly as before.
During the war he made quite a bit of money as a nail-smith.
At college he helped pay his expenses by mending
things and doing a carpenter's work.</p>

<p>If Eli Whitney were living to-day he would surely

those days, so he decided to teach. He found a position
in far-off Georgia, and took passage on a ship to Savannah.
On board ship he found the widow of the old war
hero, General Nathanael Greene, whom he had met a
short time before. She liked the young man for his
friendly nature and his intelligence. He had a very

from the seed before it could be spun. In those
days the seeds were taken out by hand, and even a skillful
slave could clean only about a pound a day. Think of
working a whole day for a handful of cotton! Because
of this difficulty, cotton was very expensive, more so
even than wool or linen. Only well-to-do people could
wear cotton clothes.</p>

clean the cotton. Mrs. Greene thought of Whitney. She
had seen him make many wonderful things. She believed
he could make
such a machine,
and asked him to
try. He thought
about it, and believed
he could
make iron fingers
do the work that
the fingers of the
slaves had done.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Whitney

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Invents

<p>Whitney got a
basketful of cotton and fixed up a shop. Then he went
to work. He had a good deal of trouble, but he kept on.
One day he called in Mrs. Greene and her overseer and
proudly showed them his little machine, made of rollers
and wires and brushes. Into this he poured the cotton
just as it came from the field. When he turned a crank
the soft, clean cotton came tumbling out of one side and
the seeds out of another. This was the cotton gin, which
in a few years was to change the entire life of the South.</p>

<p>A few years before Whitney made the cotton gin a
vessel came to Liverpool with cotton from the United
States. The people in Liverpool were astonished. They
did not know that cotton grew in America! As soon as
Whitney began to sell his new machines, all the South
became a great cotton field. In 1825, the year of
Whitney's death, the South shipped abroad thirty-seven
million dollars' worth of cotton, more than that of all
other goods exported from this country!</p>

<p>Before this time many planters had thought that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
slavery was unnecessary. But when Whitney's gin
made cotton growing so profitable, they had to have
many more laborers to raise this new crop. Thousands
of black slaves were sold to the cotton-growing parts of
the South. The planters then believed they could not
grow cotton without slaves, and it took a terrible war
to settle the great question of slave labor.</p>

<p><strong>115. The Early Years of Jefferson.</strong> The author of
the Declaration of Independence was born in 1743, near
Charlottesville, Virginia. Like most other Virginia boys,
Thomas Jefferson
lived on a large
plantation, and
spent much time
in hunting, fishing,
and horseback riding.
While yet a
boy, and throughout
his long life,
Jefferson loved
books and studied
hard every subject
that came before
his mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Goes to

<p><em>Here Jefferson heard Patrick Henry make his famous

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A wonderful
old town</strong></div>

<p>Although Williamsburg was the capital of the largest
and oldest of all the colonies, it had scarcely more than two
hundred houses,
and not more
than a thousand
people. But it
was a wonderful
town in Jefferson's
eyes, although it
had but one main
street. The capitol
stood at one
end of the street
and the college at the other. It was the first town
Thomas Jefferson had ever seen.</p>

<p>At the opening of the House of Burgesses, Jefferson
saw the best people in the Old Colony come pouring in.
The planters came in fine coaches drawn by beautiful
horses. The wives and daughters came to attend the
governor's reception, and to enjoy meeting their old
friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>He knew
great
men</strong></div>

<p>Jefferson became acquainted with the great men of
his colony, and with many young men who were to be
the future leaders in America. Here he met Patrick
Henry, a student in a law office. Jefferson liked the
fun-making Henry, and the two young men enjoyed
many happy hours together, playing their violins.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Studies
law</strong></div>

<p>After his graduation Jefferson remained in his old
college town to study law in the office of one of Virginia's
ablest lawyers. Henry often lodged in Jefferson's rooms
when he came to attend the meetings of the Burgesses.
When Henry made his stirring speech against the Stamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Act, Jefferson stood in the doorway of the House and
listened spellbound to his friend's fiery eloquence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Jefferson

<p>In a few years Jefferson himself was honored with a
seat in the House of Burgesses. He immediately took a
leading part in opposing the tax on tea. The king's governor
became angry and sent the members of the House
of Burgesses home. But before they went, the bolder
ones met and signed a paper which pledged the people
of Virginia to buy no more goods from England.</p>

<p>The next important event in Jefferson's life was his
falling in love, and his marriage to a young widow. She
was beautiful in looks, winning in her manner, and rich
in lands and slaves. Jefferson took his young wife to a
handsome mansion
which he had built
on his great plantation.
He called the
home Monticello.

meeting of the Burgesses, and there with other leaders
formed a Committee
of Correspondence.
This
committee wrote
to the other colonies
to get news
of what the leaders
were doing,
and to tell them
what the men in Virginia were planning to do. Each of the
other colonies appointed committees of correspondence.
They kept the news going back and forth as fast as

Continental Congress in Philadelphia. In this Congress
Richard Henry Lee made a motion declaring that the
thirteen colonies were free and independent of Great
Britain.</p>

<p>The Congress appointed Thomas Jefferson of Virginia,
John Adams of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin of

Robert R. Livingston of New York, to draw up a Declaration
of Independence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Jefferson

<p>When these great men met to talk over the Declaration,
the others urged Jefferson to do the writing, for he was
able to put his thoughts on paper in plain, strong words.
How important that the Declaration should be well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
written, and should contain powerful reasons for breaking
away from England and setting up an independent

America was driven to fight for independence.</p>

Hamilton.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Elected

<p><strong>117. Jefferson President.</strong>
In 1800 the people elected
Jefferson president. He was very popular because he
was a friend of the poor as well as of the rich people. He
declared that the new national government should in
every way be plain and simple, instead of showy like the
governments of Europe.</p>

<p>Presidents Washington and Adams had had fine receptions,
where people wore wigs, silver shoe buckles, and
fine lace. When Jefferson became president he did
away with all this show and style.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Reduces
expenses</strong></div>

<p>Jefferson also pleased the people by reducing the
expenses of the government. He cut down the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
of government clerks, soldiers in the army, and sailors in
the navy. He spent just as little money as possible in
running the government.</p>

<p>One of Jefferson's most important acts while president
was the purchase of Louisiana. Thanks to George
Rogers Clark and his brave men, England had been
forced to give the United States the Mississippi as our
western boundary.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Napoleon

<p>In 1800 Napoleon, the great French general, forced
Spain to give France all the region then known as
Louisiana, which extended from the Mississippi to the
Rocky Mountains, and from Canada to the Gulf of
Mexico. Spain, a weak country, had already refused to
permit American boats to use the mouth of the Mississippi.
What if Napoleon should send his victorious army to
Louisiana and close the Mississippi entirely? Jefferson
saw the danger at once, and sent James Monroe to Paris
to help our minister, Robert R. Livingston, one of the
signers of the Declaration of Independence, buy New
Orleans and a strip of land on the east side of the Mississippi
River near its mouth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Sells

<p>Napoleon was about to enter on a terrible war with
England, and needed money badly. He was only too

(1803). This was more than Livingston was told to
buy, but he and Monroe accepted his offer.</p>

<p>If you will count the number of great states which

<p><strong>118. Discovery of the Columbia River.</strong> The purchase
of the Louisiana territory by Jefferson opened up a great
new field for settlers. It was necessary to know something
about the new territory. It was a vast unexplored
country stretching from the Mississippi River to the
Rockies. The Pacific shore had already been visited by
explorers. Boston merchants had sent Captain Robert
Gray to the Pacific coast to buy furs of the Indians. He
did not try to find an overland route, but sailed around
South America and up the coast to Vancouver Island,
where he obtained a rich cargo of furs. He then made his
way across the Pacific to China, and came back to Boston
by way of the Cape of Good Hope&mdash;the first American
to carry the Stars and Stripes around the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Discovers

<p>On a second voyage to the same region, in the good ship

vessel. The Indians had called it the Oregon.</p>

<p><strong>119. The Lewis and Clark Expedition.</strong> The next
important step in finding a route to the Oregon country
was the great expedition undertaken
while Thomas Jefferson
was yet president.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Expedition

<p>Lewis and Clark were two
young men chosen by Jefferson
to explore the region known
as the Louisiana Purchase and
to make their way across the
Rocky Mountains to the Oregon
country and to the Pacific.
They chose forty-two men to go
with them&mdash;some as soldiers,
others as servants, and still
others as hunters. From the
little French village of St. Louis
they began their adventurous journey in boats in the
spring of 1804.</p>

<p>Up the Missouri River they slowly made their way
against the current of the muddy, rushing stream. At
one time it was so swift that they could not force boats
against it, and at another time the brushwood that came
down the river broke their oars.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Smoked
the "pipe
of peace"</strong></div>

<p>Near where the city of Council Bluffs now stands,
Lewis and Clark held a great meeting with the Indians.
They told the Indians that the people of the United
States and not the people of France were now the owners
of this great land. Together they smoked the "pipe of
peace," and the Indians promised to be friendly.</p>

<p>On they went till the region near the Black Hills was
reached. It was the fall of the year and the trees were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
bright with color, and the wild ducks and geese in large
numbers were seen going southward.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Spent the

<p>The company spent the winter on an island sixteen hundred
miles from St. Louis. The men built rude homes and
fortified them. The Indians were friendly and the explorers
spent many evenings around the wigwam fires listening
to stories of the country the Indians had to tell them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Rocky
Mountains</strong></div>

<p>In the spring they bade the Indians good-by, passed
the mouth of the Yellowstone, and traveled on till the
Rocky Mountains with their long rows of snow-covered
peaks came into view.</p>

<p>On the thirteenth day of June they beheld wonderful
pictures of the "Falls of the Missouri." The water
tore through a vast gorge a dozen miles or more in length.</p>

until their boats could go no farther. They had reached
rough and rugged hills and mountains. They climbed
the heights as best they could.
From now on the suffering was
very great indeed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

<p>One day Captain Lewis
went ahead with three men to
find Indian guides for the
party. They climbed higher
and higher until finally they
came to a place where the
Missouri River takes its rise.
They went on and at last
came to the western slope of
the mountains, down which
flowed a stream toward the
Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Finally Captain Lewis came upon a company of
Indian women who could not get away. They all bowed
their heads as if expecting to be
killed. They led the white men to a
band of Indians, who received them
with all the signs of kindness they
could show.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Indians

<p>Now they all turned back to find

<p>They were the first white men

took a deep interest in their clothing,
their food, and in their guns.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Explorers

<p>The mountains were now rough

explorers took an old Indian guide and crossed the Bitter
Root Mountains into a valley of the same name. They
followed an Indian trail over the mountains again and
into the Clearwater. They suffered for want of food
and on account of the cold. When they reached a tribe

They camped near the spot where now stands the present
town of Lewiston, Idaho. Then they embarked on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Snake River and floated down to where it joins the
mighty Columbia.</p>

<p>They were among the Indians again, who had plenty
of dried fish, for here is the home of the salmon, a fish
found in astonishing numbers. The men had never
seen so many fish before.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Explorers

<p>The number of Indians increased as they went toward
the Pacific. Finally the party of explorers passed through
the Cascade Mountains and were once more on the
smooth current of the Columbia. They soon beheld
the blue waters of the Pacific.</p>

<p>During their five months' stay on the Pacific, Captain
Clark made a map of the region they had gone through.
They repaired their guns and made clothes of the skins
of elk and of other game.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lewis

<p>The Indians told them of a shorter route to the Falls

by this route while Captain Clark with others retraced
the old route. They saw nothing of each other for two
months, when they all met again in August on the
banks of the Missouri.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>All

<p>They reached St. Louis September 23, 1806. The

thought the men were dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Rewarded

<p>Both President Jefferson and Congress put great value
upon the useful information that the expedition gathered.
Congress rewarded every one connected with the expedition.
Each man was granted double pay for the time
he spent and was given three hundred acres of land. To
Captain Lewis was given fifteen hundred acres and to Captain
Clark a thousand acres. Lewis was appointed first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
governor of Louisiana Territory and Clark was made
the governor of Missouri Territory.</p>


<p><strong>122. Fur Traders and Missionaries Lead the Way.</strong>
Soon after this expedition the fur traders pushed their
way across the Rocky Mountains from St. Louis to the
Pacific. They found the "gateway of the Rockies,"
called the South Pass, which opened the way to the
Oregon country (1824).</p>

him and began to work among the Indians. Very soon
Parker and Whitman went out to the Nez Percé Indians,
who came over the mountains to meet them near the
headwaters of the Green River. Parker returned with
the Indians and visited Walla Walla, Vancouver, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>

The United States and Great Britain made a treaty by
which they agreed to occupy the country together. This

<p><strong>124. A Young Man Who Captured a British Fleet.</strong>
Perry was born in Rhode Island in 1785. He went to
the best schools, and learned the science of navigation.
At fourteen years of age he was a midshipman on his
father's vessel, and before he was twenty-one he had
served in a war against the Barbary pirates.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Perry

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Ready

<p>When young Perry returned to his home the British
were seizing American ships, claiming the right to search
them for British sailors. Perry was very bitter toward
the British for these insults to his country, and when
war was declared he was eager to fight. A fleet of vessels
was being built on Lake Erie, and Perry was sent as
commandant to take charge of their construction. He
promptly set to work, and in a few weeks the ships were
ready for battle.</p>

made them turn all their
cannon against it. The
loss of life was dreadful,
but Perry kept cool. When
the last gun of the <em>Lawrence</em>
could no longer be
fired, he ordered a boat to
be lowered and with some
brave men rowed through a storm of shot and shell to
the <em>Niagara</em>, another of Perry's large ships. Then he
drove this ship into the midst of the fight. In fifteen
minutes the two largest British ships struck their colors.

<h3>ANDREW JACKSON, THE VICTOR OF NEW ORLEANS</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Jackson
a Scotch-Irishman</strong></div>


<p><strong>125. How a Poor Boy Began to Rise.</strong> Andrew
Jackson was born of Scotch-Irish parents who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
emigrated from Ireland to South Carolina. His father
died and his mother moved to North Carolina to be
among her own people. Here, a few days after his
father's death, in the same year in which England passed
the Tea Act (1767), Andrew was born.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Learns
from the
woods</strong></div>

<p>Schools were few and poor. In fact, Andrew was
too poor himself to do anything but work. He learned
far more from the pine woods in which he played than
from books. At nine he was a tall, slender, freckle-faced
lad, fond of sports, and full of fun and mischief.
But woe to the boy that made "Andy" angry!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Learns to
hate the
British</strong></div>

<p>When thirteen, he learned what war meant, for it was
in the days of the Revolution when Colonel Tarleton
came along and killed more than a hundred and wounded
one hundred fifty of Jackson's neighbors and friends.
Among the killed was one of the boy's own brothers.
Andrew never forgave the British.</p>

<p>At fourteen he was taken
prisoner by the British.
"Boy," shouted an officer,
"clean these boots!" "I
will not," replied Jackson.
"I am a prisoner of war,
and claim to be treated as
such." The officer drew his
sword and struck Jackson
a blow upon the head, and
another upon the hand.
These blows left scars
which Jackson carried to
his grave. He was taken a prisoner to Camden, where
smallpox killed his remaining brother and left Andrew poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
and sickly looking. His mother had come to Camden to
nurse her sons. A little later she lost her life in caring
for American prisoners
on British
ships in Charleston
Harbor, so
Jackson was now
an orphan of the
Revolution.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A lawyer
before

<p>After the Revolutionary
times
had gone by,
Jackson studied
law and at the
age of twenty
was admitted to practice in the courts of the state.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Follows
the
settlers
over the
mountains</strong></div>

<p>But stories of the beautiful country that were coming
over the mountains from Tennessee, stirred his blood.
He longed to go, and in company with nearly a hundred
men, women, and children, Jackson set out for the
goodly land.</p>

<p>They crossed the mountains into east Tennessee, where
was the town of Jonesboro, not far from where Governor
Sevier lived.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Outwits
the
Indians</strong></div>

<p>Jackson and the others rested awhile before taking up
their march to Nashville. From Jonesboro to Nashville
they had to look out for Indians. Only once were they
troubled. One night, when men, women, and children
were resting in their rude tents, Jackson sat at the foot
of a tree smoking his corncob pipe. He heard "owls"
hooting near by. These were Indian signals. "A little
too natural," thought Jackson. He aroused the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
and silently they marched away. Another party, coming
an hour or two later, stopped in the same place, and
were massacred by Indians.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Practicing
law
on the
frontier</strong></div>

<p>Arriving in Nashville, Jackson began the practice of
law. To reach the court, he sometimes had to ride miles
and miles, day after day, through thick forests where
the Indians might lie in wait.</p>

<p>When Tennessee was made a territory, Jackson became
district attorney. He had many "ups and downs"
with the bad men of the frontier. Jackson himself had
a bad temper, and woe to the man who made him angry.
He either got a sound thrashing or had to fight a duel.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>In
Congress</strong></div>

<p>When Tennessee became a state, Jackson was elected
to Congress. A year or so afterward (1797) he was
appointed a United States senator to fill a vacancy.
But such a position did not give him excitement enough,
so he resigned the next year and returned to Nashville.
He was a frontier judge for a time, then he became a
man of business.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A call to
arms</strong></div>


<p><strong>126. How Jackson Won a Great Victory.</strong> When
the War of 1812 broke out there was a call to arms!
The British will capture New Orleans! Twenty-five
hundred frontiersmen rallied to Jackson's call. He was
just the man to lead them. They decided to go to New
Orleans by water.</p>

<p>Down the Cumberland to the Ohio in boats! Down
the Ohio to the Mississippi, and down the Mississippi
to Natchez! Here they stopped, only to learn that there
were no British near.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>How he
won the
name
"Old
Hickory"</strong></div>

<p>The twenty-five hundred men marched the long,
dreary way home. Jackson was the toughest one among
them. He could march farther and last longer without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
food than any of them. The soldiers nicknamed him
"Old Hickory."</p>

<p>Once more he was at home, where he now was a great
man among his friends. About this time Jackson had
a fierce fight with Thomas H. Benton and received a
pistol shot in the shoulder. Before he was again well the
people who suffered from the Fort Mims massacre were
calling loudly for help. Tecumseh had stirred up the
Creeks to murder five hundred men, women, and children
at this fort in Alabama.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Jackson

<p>Twenty-five hundred men answered Jackson's call.
They marched south through a barren country. Food
was scarce. His army, almost starved, threatened to go
home. A half-starved soldier saw Jackson sitting under
a tree and asked him for something to eat. Looking up,
Jackson said: "It has always been a rule with me never
to turn away a hungry
man. I will cheerfully
divide with you."
Then he drew from his
pocket a few acorns,
saying: "This is the
best and only fare I
have."</p>

<p>But Jackson soon
received reënforcements,
and then, in spite of all
these drawbacks, he
broke the power of the
Creeks in the great
battle of Horseshoe
Bend on the Tallapoosa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
River in Alabama. After that the Indians were only
too glad to cease fighting and sue for peace.</p>

before President

guard New Orleans
from the British.</p>

<p>After attacking and capturing Pensacola, a Spanish
fort which the English occupied, he hurried his army on
to New Orleans. Nothing had been done to defend the
city. Jackson immediately declared martial law. He
threw himself with all the energy he had into getting
New Orleans ready, for the British troops were already
landing.</p>

They were

<p>Jackson had not long to wait. On came the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
in solid column, with flags flying and drums beating.
The fog was breaking away. Behind the breastworks

<p>President Jackson had a quarrel with the men who
were managing the United States Bank. This bank
kept the money for the government. He ordered that
the money of the government be taken out of this bank
and put in different State Banks which were called
"pet" banks. In the Senate of the United States at
this time were three men of giant-like ability&mdash;Henry
Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun. They
joined together to oppose President Jackson in his fight
against the United States Bank. These men made many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
long and very bitter speeches against the president.</p>

<p>The Senate finally passed a resolution blaming President
Jackson for taking the money away from the United
States Bank. President Jackson was furious. He wrote
a protest and sent it to the Senate. The people in the
states took sides, and the excitement spread to all parts

several years, he succeeded in getting the Senate to
expunge, or take away, from their records the resolution
blaming President Jackson.</p>

and planned the committees of correspondence. <em>12.</em> Jefferson
was sent to the Congress of 1776 and wrote the Declaration of
Independence. <em>13.</em> After the war Jefferson was sent as
Minister to France. <em>14.</em> Washington chose him as Secretary
of State, and he founded the Democratic-Republican party.
<em>15.</em> Jefferson was popular as president. <em>16.</em> He cut down
expenses, and with his savings in running the government
purchased Louisiana.</p>

<p><em>17.</em> The Columbia River was discovered by Gray. <em>18.</em> The
way to the Oregon country was made known by Lewis and
Clark. <em>19.</em> The Indians received them with kindness along
the route. <em>20.</em> They followed the Columbia until they reached
the Pacific; Clark made a map of the region they had gone
through. <em>21.</em> As a reward, Lewis was appointed governor of
the Louisiana Territory and Clark of the Missouri Territory.
<em>22.</em> Fur traders and missionaries soon found their way to the
Oregon country.</p>

<p><em>23.</em> Perry went to serve against the pirates, was eager to
fight the English when war broke out, and was appointed
commandant at Lake Erie. <em>24.</em> Perry built a fleet and won a
famous victory over the English. <em>25.</em> A gold medal was
struck in his honor by Congress.</p>

<p><em>26.</em> Andrew Jackson was born of poor parents; learned from

<div class="sidenote"><strong>How

<p><strong>128. The Invention of the Steamboat.</strong> Once there
were no steam engines to drive boats. On sea and river
they were driven by wind, and on canals they were
pulled along by horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Inventors
before
Fulton</strong></div>

<p>James Rumsey on the Potomac, John Fitch on the
Delaware, and William Longstreet on the Savannah had
each invented and tried some kind of steamboat, before
Robert Fulton.</p>

<p>Fulton was born of Irish parents, in New Britain,
Pennsylvania, in 1765. At the age of three he lost his
father. Young Fulton had a great taste for drawing,
painting, and inventing.</p>

<p><em>After the painting by Benjamin West</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>He went to Philadelphia, then the largest city in the
Union, when he was twenty, and engaged in painting
and drawing. His first savings
were given to his widowed
mother to make her comfortable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Studied
under
Benjamin
West</strong></div>

<p>Fulton finally decided to be
an artist, and went to England
to make his home with
Benjamin West, a great painter
who once lived at Philadelphia.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Influenced
to
become
an engineer</strong></div>

<p>There he became acquainted
with the Duke of Bridgewater,
who influenced him to become
a civil engineer. Fulton now
met James Watt, who had
greatly improved the steam
engine. At one time the young man aided Watt in
building an engine.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Meets
Livingston
in
France</strong></div>

<p>Fulton next went to France, where he became interested
in plans for inventing diving boats, torpedoes, and
steamboats. Here he met Robert R. Livingston, a signer
of the Declaration of Independence, then United States
Minister to France. Livingston took a deep interest in
his experiments in driving boats by steam, and furnished
him the means to make them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Fulton's
trial
boats</strong></div>

<p>Fulton made a "model" boat, which he left in France.
Shortly afterward, he built a boat twenty-six feet long
and eight feet wide. In this vessel he put a steam engine.
The trial trips proved beyond a doubt that steamboats
could be made.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Twenty
years'
rights</strong></div>

<p>Livingston believed in Fulton and his steamboat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
When he returned to New York, Livingston obtained
from the legislature the right to navigate the waters of
the state by steam for twenty years. The one condition
was that the boat should go against the current of the
Hudson at the rate of four miles an hour.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Gets engine

England</strong></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
"Clermont"</strong></div>

<p>Fulton got his engine from the inventors, Watt and
Boulton, in England&mdash;the only place where suitable
engines could be found. The engine came in 1806.
A boat called the <em>Clermont</em> was built to carry it. She was
one hundred thirty feet long and eighteen feet wide.
She had a mast with a sail. At both ends she was decked
over, and in the middle the engine was placed. Two
large side-wheels dipped two feet into the water.</p>

<p><strong>129. The "Clermont" Moves.</strong> At one o'clock in the
afternoon of August 7, 1807, a great crowd gathered to
see the first voyage of the <em>Clermont</em>. Many people did
not expect to see the vessel go. They believed Fulton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
and Livingston had spent their money for nothing.
Fulton gave his signal from the deck of the <em>Clermont</em>.
The people looked on in astonishment as the boat moved
steadily up the pathway of the Hudson.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A great

Fulton

<p>The <em>Clermont</em> kept on going till out of sight, and
the crowds of wondering people went home hardly
believing the evidence of their eyes. Up the river,
against the current of the mighty Hudson, she made her
way till Albany was reached. She had gone one hundred
fifty miles in thirty-two hours, and won a great victory
for Fulton and Livingston.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Name

<p>When winter came the <em>Clermont</em> was taken out of
the water and rebuilt. They covered her from stem to
stern with a deck. Under the deck they built two
cabins, with a double row of berths. Everything was done
to make her attractive in the eyes of the people. They
changed her name to the <em>North River</em>. In the spring she
made her trips regularly up and down the Hudson.</p>

another on the
Raritan, and a

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>People

<p>In 1811 a steamboat was built on the Ohio River at
Pittsburgh. It started on its trip down the beautiful
Ohio. People
gathered on the
banks of the river
to see it go by.
The steamboat,
at first, made a
frightful noise.
Hence when it
came to places
where news traveled
slowly, the
people were sometimes
frightened,
and the negroes, terror stricken, ran crying into the woods.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A steamboat
helped
Jackson</strong></div>

<p>In 1814 a steamboat carried supplies to General Jackson
at New Orleans, and helped him to win the great battle
fought there.</p>

<p>Seven steamboats were running on the Ohio and the
Mississippi at the close of the War of 1812. Before
another year went by, a steamboat had made its way
from New Orleans against the currents of the Mississippi
and the Ohio rivers to Louisville, laden with goods from
Europe.</p>

<p>The steamboat had now won a place on the American
rivers. It aided in the rapid settlement of the country.
It made travel quick and easy, and it carried the goods of
settlers up and down the rivers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Robert
Fulton
dies, 1815</strong></div>

<p>Robert Fulton died in 1815, deeply mourned by all his
countrymen, and was buried in Trinity churchyard,
New York City.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Erie
Canal
across
New
York</strong></div>


<p><strong>131. The Erie Canal.</strong> Before Fulton invented the
steamboat, supplies had been carried to the western
settlers over the mountains from the East. Now,
however, steamboats puffed up the Mississippi from
New Orleans loaded down with goods that had been
brought all the way from Europe. The settlers could get
all the supplies they wanted and at a much lower cost.
For this reason the merchants of New York and the East
were in danger of losing all their trade with the settlers.
They saw that they must have some connection with the
West by water, and so they planned the Erie Canal.
It took seven years to dig. When it was finished it
was three hundred sixty-three miles long, forty feet wide,
and four feet deep. The depth was later increased to
seven feet. It stretched straight across the state of
New York from Lake Erie to the Hudson River.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1825, when the canal was finished,
there was a great celebration. A "fleet" of canal boats
carried Governor Clinton of New York and a number of
other distinguished men across the state.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>New York
recovered
her trade</strong></div>

<p>The merchants of the East were no longer afraid of the
Mississippi route, for they had a route of their own.
The canal became the great highway of commerce from
the East to the West and from the West to the East.
New York recovered her trade, and flourishing cities grew
up along the canal.</p>

<p>But there were cities in the East that could not use
the canal. Farther south they could not dig a canal
across the mountains. All their goods had to be carried
over the Cumberland Gap on the backs of horses. But
a new means of travel and transportation had been
invented, which was to far surpass the steamboat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
which was to help every city no matter where located.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
first
railroad</strong></div>


<p><strong>132. Railroad Building.</strong> The first railroad in America
was a very rude affair. There were no "palace cars"
or steel rails, nor did the trains run at a speed of sixty
miles an hour. Instead, cars that looked like huge
wagons ran on wooden rails and were dragged along by
horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Stephenson's
"Puffing
Billy"</strong></div>

<p>But George Stephenson had thought out a plan for a
machine that would pull the cars along by steam. He
called his engine "Puffing Billy." He kept at work
always improving it. In 1825, after eleven years of hard
work, he made an engine that could pull both passengers
and freight.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
first
long
railroad</strong></div>

<p>In 1828 the first long railroad in America was started.
A great ceremony took place. It was a very solemn
occasion. Charles Carroll, the only living signer of the
Declaration of Independence, drove the first spade into
the ground where the first rail was to be laid. As he
did so he said, "I consider this among the most important
acts of my life, second only to that of signing the
Declaration of Independence." This railroad was the
famous Baltimore &amp; Ohio.</p>

<p>Inventors continued to improve the locomotive. In
1831 an American company built one which ran at the
rate of fifteen miles an hour. At that time that was considered
a very rapid rate.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>By rail
from
Boston to
Buffalo</strong></div>

<p>Since then railroad building and transportation have
improved wonderfully. By 1842 one could travel by rail
from Boston to Buffalo. But it was not until ten years
later that Chicago was connected by rail with the East.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>To the
Pacific
coast</strong></div>

<p>Gradually the railroads spread a network over the
country. In 1857 St. Louis and Chicago were connected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
A railroad to the Pacific coast was much needed, and
Congress voted an appropriation of $50,000,000 for the
work. By 1869 the great work was completed. Other
lines to the coast were started, and to-day many railroads
cross the mountains, connecting the Pacific with the
North, South, and Atlantic regions.</p>

<h3>SAMUEL F. B. MORSE, INVENTOR OF THE TELEGRAPH</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Morse,
1791</strong></div>


<p><strong>133. The Coming of the Telegraph.</strong> Samuel Morse
was born in Massachusetts (1791). His father was a
Presbyterian minister. Young Morse went to the
common schools and to Yale College.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MORSE WORKING ON HIS MACHINE</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Paints

<p>In college he used his spare time in painting, and after
graduation he went
to England and
studied under the
best artists. He
came home and for
a time painted portraits
for a living.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The idea

him of

<p>After having
spent some years
abroad, in work and

again returning
home from France
when the idea of
sending news by
electricity first came
to him.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE FIRST TELEGRAPH

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A
machine

<p>"Why can't it be?" said Morse to a friend, who
answered, "There is great need of sending news by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
electricity." He began, then and there, to plan a
machine and to invent an alphabet. This was all done
on shipboard. When he reached
land he went to work with a will
at his new-found problem.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
hungry
inventor</strong></div>

<p>For a long time the work went
on very slowly, for inventors must
eat and sleep and pay their way
in the world. While Morse was
struggling over his machine and
trying to make himself master of
the strange force called electricity,
he was very often hungry and at
times even on the point of starvation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Alfred
Vail</strong></div>

<p>Now came a bright spot in his career. A young man
named Alfred Vail, an excellent mechanic, saw Morse's
telegraph instruments, and immediately believed they
would be successful. Young Vail borrowed money and
became Morse's assistant in the great work. For what
he did he deserves credit next to Morse himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Getting
ready for
Congress</strong></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Behind

doors</strong></div>

<p>A patent must now be had and the telegraph must be
so improved that they could show it to a committee of
Congress. It was arranged that Vail and a mechanic
by the name of Baxter should do the work behind locked
doors. For, if some one should happen to see the instruments,
and obtain a patent first, then Morse and Vail
would be ruined.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The dot
and dash
alphabet</strong></div>

<p>In the locked shop the two men worked steadily day
after day. Vail made many improvements. Among
these was the new "dot and dash" alphabet. At last,
one day in January, 1838, everything was in complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
working order. Baxter, hatless and coatless, ran for
Mr. Vail's father to come at once and see the telegraph
work.</p>

<p>At one end of

young Vail, and
at the other stood
Morse. This wire
was stretched
around the room
so that it was
three miles in
length. The elder
Vail wrote: "A patient waiter is no loser." He said to
his son: "If you can send this message, and Mr. Morse can
read it at the other end, I shall be convinced." It was
done, and there was great rejoicing. The invention was
hurried to Washington,
and young
Vail took out a
patent in the
name of Morse.</p>

<p>Morse obtained
permission to set

capitol. These
rooms were filled
with congressmen
watching the strange business. Members in one room
would carry on witty conversations with persons in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>

<p><strong>134. The Government Aids.</strong>
Finally Morse asked for thirty
thousand dollars to build a line
from Washington to Baltimore.
The bill met opposition, one
member moving that a part of
the money be used in building
a railroad to the moon, another
that it be used in making experiments
in mesmerism.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Morse

<p>Morse stood leaning against
the railing which separated the
outsiders from the members.
He was greatly excited, and
turning to a friend, said: "I
have spent seven years and all that I have in making this
instrument perfect. If it succeeds, I am a made man;
if it fails, I am ruined. I have a large family, and not
money enough to pay my board bill when I leave the city."</p>

In the morning a friend met and congratulated him on
the action of Congress in granting thirty thousand
dollars for his telegraph line&mdash;the last thing Congress did
that night. Morse was surprised. The telegraph line
to Baltimore was built and the first dispatch was ready
to send. Morse called the young woman who had been
the first to congratulate him, to send this first message:
"What hath God wrought."</p>

<h3>CYRUS WEST FIELD, WHO LAID THE ATLANTIC CABLE
BETWEEN AMERICA AND EUROPE</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>In business

<p><strong>136. The Atlantic Cable.</strong> Cyrus W. Field was born
in Massachusetts in 1819. His grandfather was a
Revolutionary soldier. Cyrus went to school in his
native town of Stockbridge, and at fifteen was given a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
place in a New York store at fifty dollars a year. Before
he was twenty-one he went into business for himself.
At the end of a dozen years he was the head of a prosperous
firm. In 1853 he retired from active business.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Why not
span the
Atlantic?</strong></div>

<p>Field became interested in a man who was joining
Newfoundland with the mainland by means of a telegraph
line. "Why not make a telegraph line to span the
Atlantic?" thought Field. He went to work, and put
his schemes before Peter Cooper and other generous men.
They believed in them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Englishmen
also
approve
the plan</strong></div>

<p>Field next went abroad and laid his plan before a
number of Englishmen. He pleaded so eloquently that
they, too, were convinced. He returned to America to
lay the matter before Congress and ask that body to
vote him a sum of money.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>President

<p>Congress was very slow about it, and the bill did not
pass until the last days of that session. President Pierce
signed it the last day of his term as president.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Half a

<p>Field returned to England and watched over the making
of his "cable." In August, 1857, everything was ready.
The cable lay coiled on shipboard,
ready to be let out in
the Atlantic. The great ship
started, and everything went
well till three hundred thirty-five
miles of the cable had
been let out, when it broke
in two. It was the same as
losing half a million dollars.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A second

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Breaks

<p>Field went back to England
and began promptly to prepare for a second trial. He
then came to America and made arrangements to use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the <em>Niagara</em>, a large vessel. The British ship, <em>Agamemnon</em>,
was also taken to help in this second trial. The
ships started in mid-ocean, one going one way and one
going the other way. This time only one hundred eleven
miles were laid, when the cable again parted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A council
of war</strong></div>

<p>Field hastened to London to meet the men who had
backed him in his undertaking with their money. It
was a council of war after a terrible defeat! But Mr.
Field did not believe in surrender, even to the sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Success</strong></div>

<p>On the seventeenth of July, 1858, the ships again set
sail for mid-ocean. They "spliced" the cable, and
the <em>Niagara</em> with Mr. Field on board sailed away for
Newfoundland. The British ship went the other way.
This time they were successful. Both countries were
excited. Queen Victoria flashed a message under the
sea to President Buchanan.</p>

<h3>CYRUS H. M<sup>c</sup>CORMICK, INVENTOR OF THE REAPER</h3>


<p><strong>138. Making Bread More Plentiful for Millions.</strong>
It was only natural that Cyrus H. McCormick should be
interested in inventions. His father, Robert McCormick,
had fitted up many labor-saving devices for use on his
farm. He tried to make a reaper, but it was a failure.</p>

<p>One hundred years ago the common method of harvesting
in this country was by "cradling" the grain. For
this, a scythe with prongs on its handle was used. The
prongs caught the grain and laid it in rows, ready to tie.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 502px;">
<img src="images/i_272a.jpg" width="502" height="540" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>CYRUS HALL M<sup>c</sup>CORMICK</p></div>
</div>

<p>Cyrus Hall McCormick was born at Walnut Grove,
West Virginia, in 1809. The boy was always interested
in inventing. When fifteen,
he invented a better grain
cradle. At twenty-one he
made a hillside plow that
surpassed his father's. His
great invention, the reaper,
was made the following year.
His friends all laughed at
his machine, but he went on
perfecting it. All his life
Cyrus McCormick had to
meet ridicule or bitter competition.
But he came of
Scotch-Irish fighting stock. He had the determination
which battles its way to success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE FIRST M<sup>c</sup>CORMICK REAPER</p>

<p><em>After a model of the original reaper</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>In 1834 the reaper was patented. It was shown at
the World's Fair in London in 1851. It won a prize as
the most valuable thing
in the whole fair.</p>

<p>Cyrus H. McCormick
started to manufacture
his machine at Chicago
in 1847. The demand
for reapers grew rapidly.
When the Civil War called
out one man in three from
the North, there were
enough reapers in use to
equal the labor of one million slaves. The North not only
fed itself but sent great quantities of grain to England.
Cyrus McCormick's great invention did much to help the
North abolish slavery.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 540px;">
<img src="images/i_273b.jpg" width="540" height="209" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>HARVESTING WITH MODERN MACHINERY</p></div>
</div>


<p><strong>139. Reapers for the West.</strong> The invention of the
reaper made it possible for the West to be quickly settled.
Before, farmers raised only the few acres they could be
sure of harvesting. Grain is lost, if not cut a few days
after it is ripe. The wide prairies of the West could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
be harvested by the old methods. Now on these great
plains huge reapers drawn by engines sometimes cut
forty-eight feet of grain in a single swathe.</p>

<p>Because of the labor it saves, McCormick's invention
has made the cost of bread low for millions of people.
With hand-reaping half the people of the country would
be busy producing nothing but bread. In the past most
nations were never free from the danger of starvation.
Now the world produces enough for all.</p>

<p>A noted French society, when it elected McCormick a
member, said that he had "done more for the cause of
agriculture than any other living man."</p>

<h3>ELIAS HOWE, INVENTOR OF THE SEWING MACHINE</h3>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<img src="images/i_274a.jpg" width="468" height="540" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>ELIAS HOWE</p></div>
</div>


<p><strong>140. A Time-Saving Invention.</strong> Elias Howe was a
poor boy who won great riches through his invention, but
spent most of his years in a
long, dreary struggle with
poverty.</p>

<p>Elias was born in Massachusetts
in 1819. His father
was a poor man. He worked
in his father's mill and then
in the cotton mills of New
England until he came to
have a thorough knowledge
of machinery. When he was
twenty-four he began his
great invention, the sewing
machine.</p>

<p>Sewing machines using a chain stitch had already been
invented in England and France, but a chain stitch ravels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
easily. Howe invented a lock stitch machine. Like
earlier machines, it had a needle with an eye in its point
to bring a loop of thread through
the cloth. In chain stitching the
needle at the next stitch passes
through this loop. Howe instead
passed a shuttle carrying a second
thread through the loop. This
made a firm lock stitch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">
<img src="images/i_275a.jpg" width="452" height="540" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>HOWE'S FIRST SEWING MACHINE</p></div>
</div>

<p>Howe tried to get tailors to buy
his machine. He proved that it
would sew seven times as fast as
the best needleworkers. But they
were afraid it would take work
away from their men, and would have nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>After patenting his machine, Howe took it to England,
but there he remained as poor and unknown as before.</p>

<p>Returning to New York he heard that unscrupulous
men had stolen or "pirated" his ideas, and that the sale
of sewing machines was now a thriving business. But
Howe was determined to uphold his rights. In 1859,
after a battle of many years in the law courts, he secured
the full and complete title to his invention.</p>


<p><strong>141. A Turn in Fortune.</strong> The man who had faced
poverty and rebuffs all his days now came into great
wealth. His income each year would be equal to-day to
at least a million dollars.</p>

<p>Sewing machines have now become almost a necessity
in all American homes. It is hard to realize the amount
of close, slow, exacting work from which Howe's machine
has released women everywhere. The work of the most
skillful needlewomen is not to be compared in speed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
evenness with machine stitching. Garments now can be
produced in vastly greater quantities than by hand work,
and machine stitching is much more durable.</p>

<p>When the Civil War came, Howe's sewing machine
made tents, shoes, and uniforms for the great Union army
which would not have had them in time otherwise. Howe
himself enlisted as a private and served while his health
lasted. He died in 1867 when only forty-eight years old.</p>

<h3>DAVID CROCKETT, GREAT HUNTER AND HERO OF
THE ALAMO</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Crockett
found
his
schooling
in the
woods</strong></div>


<p><strong>143. A Brave Backwoodsman.</strong> At the close of the
Revolution, Tennessee was still largely a wilderness.
Here David Crockett was born in 1786. In those days
schools on the frontier were few and poor, and young
"Davy" found most of his schooling in the backwoods.
He learned to know the woods and streams and the
animals that lived in them. As a boy he spent most of
his time hunting and trapping. As a young man he was
one of the most famous rifle shots in the United States.</p>

<p>When the Creek War broke out, he enlisted under
Andrew Jackson to march against the Indians. The
young rifleman fought so well under "Old Hickory"
that Tennessee made him a colonel.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Elected
to
Congress</strong></div>

<p>He had become a famous hunter and fighter. He
thought he would try politics next. Instead of making
political speeches, he went about from place to place
telling stories. The people liked both him and his stories
so well that they elected him to the legislature. A few
years later they sent him to Congress.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Returns

wilderness</strong></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Joins
the fight
at the
Alamo</strong></div>

<p>By and by Crockett grew tired of civilization. He
wanted to get back to the wilderness. His old home was
too well settled to suit him. So he wandered to Texas.
Here he heard that the Mexicans were surrounding the
Americans at San Antonio. "Davy" Crockett loved a
good fight too well to stay away. He hastened to join
the small band of brave men who were defending the
Alamo. All could have escaped had they chosen to do
so, but with iron courage these hundred and forty stayed
and defied Santa Ana's thousands.</p>

by scores, but when one Mexican fell another took his
place. One by one the fearless defenders fell. The last
man to go down was Davy Crockett.</p>

<p>It is said that he stood with his back to the wall,
fighting to the last, and that the Mexicans, afraid to

<div class="sidenote"><strong>His

<p><strong>144. A Great Explorer.</strong> Fremont's father was a
Frenchman who was driven to America by the terrible
French Revolution. John Charles Fremont was born at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Savannah (1813) while his parents were on a journey
through the South. His father died soon after, and his
mother went to live in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Goes to
South
America</strong></div>

<p>After a time at a good school, Fremont entered the
junior class in Charleston College (1828). After leaving
college he spent two and a half years on a voyage to
South America.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Becomes
a civil
engineer</strong></div>

<p>On his return he joined a company of engineers sent by
the governor to explore the mountains between South
Carolina and Tennessee, in order to find a suitable place
for a railroad. This work was through a region rough,
wild, and full of beauty. It gave young Fremont a taste
for exploration which never left him.</p>

<p>Fremont's longing for a wild life was gratified when
he was made assistant to a famous Frenchman who was
exploring the wild region between the upper Missouri
River and Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Receives

<p>In 1842 Fremont, now a lieutenant

Rocky Mountains. With a party made up largely of
French Canadians, and assisted by that famous guide,
Kit Carson, he passed up the Kansas River, crossed
to the Platte, went up this river, and thus reached the
South Pass.</p>

into the Atlantic, and of others that stretched away
through unknown regions to the Pacific. He took four
men and climbed what has since been called Fremonts
Peak, one of the highest of the Rockies, about 13,800
feet above the sea. At the top Fremont unfurled the
Stars and Stripes in all its glory!</p>


<p><strong>146. A Pathway to the Pacific.</strong> Fremont reported
his discovery at Washington and immediately applied
for orders to make an expedition to discover a more
southerly route to California and Oregon.</p>

<p>He left the little town of Kansas City with his guide,
Kit Carson, in May, 1843. In September, after traveling
seventeen hundred miles,
the little party beheld the
shores of Great Salt Lake.
What feelings must have stirred
the breasts of men shut in for
months by mountains, at seeing
what appeared to be an ocean,
here in the midst of a continent!
Little did they dream of that
hardy band of immigrants, so
soon to follow, who would
make the shores of this sea blossom like a garden. Fremont
wrote: "As we looked over that vast expanse of
water and strained our eyes along the silent shores,
over which hung so much doubt and uncertainty, I could
hardly repress the almost irresistible desire to continue
our exploration."</p>

<p>November 10, on the way home, the little party started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
to make the circuit of the Great Basin, a vast depression
beyond the east wall of the Sierra Nevada. But very
soon they found
deep snow on the
mountains. Turning
to the west at
about the latitude of
San Francisco, Fremont
determined to
cross the Sierra Nevada
into the valley
of the Sacramento.
The river was not
many miles distant.</p>

<p>But what miles!
Up and down, up
and down that snowy
mountain range,
which the Indians
told him no man could cross in winter, with snow lying
upon it as deep as the dark forest trees were high, and
places where, if a man slipped off, he would fall half a
mile without stopping!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>In the

<p>They attempted to cross without a guide, in the
dead of winter. In forty days the men and the surviving
horses&mdash;a woeful procession crawling along one by
one, skeleton men leading skeleton horses&mdash;arrived at
Sutter's Fort (Sacramento) in the beautiful valley of the
Sacramento. Here genial warmth, trees in foliage,
grassy ground, and flowers made a fairy contrast to the
famine and freezing they had met on the mountains
they had climbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>After enjoying the hospitality of Colonel Sutter,

gap or pass.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Sees the

<h3>SPANISH MISSIONS IN THE SOUTHWEST</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Spanish
missionaries
baptize
Indians</strong></div>


<p><strong>149. How the Franciscans Ruled the Southwest.</strong>
Centuries before Fremont or Kit Carson or any other
American had seen the wonders of our western country,
Spaniards made their homes there. Before the <em>Mayflower</em>
landed at Plymouth, Spanish missionaries had
built many churches in the Southwest and had baptized
thousands of Indians into the Christian faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Franciscan
friars
friends
of the
oppressed</strong></div>

<p>The story of the Spaniards in New Mexico, Arizona,
and California is not of victories won by the sword, but
by the cross. The men who ruled this country were not
soldiers, but pious Franciscan friars.</p>

<p>Many years ago there lived in Italy a godly man,
St. Francis, who looked upon all poor and oppressed
people as his children and devoted his life to their care.
His followers, who are called Franciscan friars, have gone
into all parts of the world to be missionaries to the poor
and the heathen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Serra
builds a
mission
at San
Diego</strong></div>

<p>Greatest of the Franciscans who worked in the Southwest
was Junipero Serra. One warm day in 1769 he
came riding into San Diego on mule-back, a tall, thin
figure, wrapped in a long gown. There were no missionaries
at this time in California. He had come from
Mexico with a small party to convert the Indians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
At San Diego he saw "valleys studded with trees, wild
vines covered with grapes, and native roses as fair and
sweet as those of Castile."</p>

<p>Here was just the place to build a mission. First he set
up a great wooden cross and said mass. There was no
organ music, so the soldiers fired their arms instead. The
simple Indians stood by in wonder and awe. Junipero
Serra was a man of energy and action, and in a short
time he had his first mission built. From San Diego he
went northward and planted mission after mission as far
north as San Francisco. When he died the Franciscan
missions controlled practically all of southern California.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Mission
buildings
surrounded
by
gardens</strong></div>

<p>Wherever the friars built a mission they made sure
the soil was good and that there was plenty of water
near by. For in much of that country little rain falls
and many crops grow only when watered by irrigation.
Having found a suitable place, they would then build a
church. This was always the largest building of the
mission. Some of the churches were very beautiful.
Around the church clustered the houses of the friars
and the huts of the Indians. Each mission was surrounded
by beautiful gardens and orchards. A little
farther away were the fields in which the grain was
grown. All of these were watered by irrigation ditches
that drew their water from some mountain stream.
Beyond the cultivated land lay the ranches on which
cattle and sheep grazed in great numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Indians
taught
useful
occupations</strong></div>

<p>All the Indians in the neighborhood were made to live
at the mission, and here they were taught the Christian
religion. They were also taught many useful occupations.
The men were shown how to farm, to make saddles, work
at the forge and the carpenter bench, and other useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
trades. The women were instructed in spinning and
weaving.</p>

<p>In the morning the angelus called every one to mass.
After breakfast the day's work began and each Indian
was sent to his task. Some cultivated the fields, some
took care of the stock, some worked in the shops. Each
one had to do his share of the work, and was punished
if he disobeyed. He had to work, pray, and live as the
friars told him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Missions
fall to
ruin</strong></div>

<p>When Mexico freed itself of Spanish rule, California
became a part of Mexico. The new government put an
end to the missions. The friars were forced to leave, and
the Indians drifted back into their old wild life.</p>

<p>To-day nothing remains of the work of the friars except
the old mission buildings. Most of them are in ruins,
but they still tell of the quiet by-gone days when the
gentle Franciscans ruled in California.</p>

Slashes"</strong></div>

<p>Little Henry lived near the "Slashes," the name given
to a low, flat region, and went to school in a log cabin.
When not at school he worked on the farm, helping to
do his share in support of the family. He could be seen
walking barefooted behind the plow, or riding the horse
with a rope bridle to mill. From this he was called the
"Mill boy of the Slashes."</p>

<p>Henry was a raw-boned and awkward lad. The other
boys laughed at him, but he read books when not at
work, and soon could speak far better than the boys who
made fun of him.</p>

<p>At fourteen he was a

<p>The Chancellor of

private secretary. For four years Clay wrote down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>

Clay on important subjects and advised him about the

read.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Leader

<p>After studying
law for a year,
Clay began to practice
in Richmond.
He had plenty of
time, so he formed
a debating club, in
which he was easily
the leader.</p>

<p>Finally he made
up his mind to go
to Lexington, Kentucky,
and try his fortune in the West. There his rise
in the law was rapid. His fame grew, and he became
known as the lawyer who seldom lost a case.</p>

<p>He married a well-to-do young lady and lived near
Lexington on a beautiful estate called Ashland.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Favors

<p>Henry Clay's first work in politics was to favor the

<p>When too young, according to the Constitution, to

<p>Born during the Revolution, Henry Clay, like most
Americans of his time, grew up with hatred toward England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
in his heart. He was sent to Congress in 1811, and was
elected Speaker of the House of Representatives. As
Speaker, he did much to
bring on a declaration of
war with Great Britain, in
1812.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The War
of 1812</strong></div>

<p>Clay made speeches in
Congress and over the country,
stirring up the war
spirit. "On to Canada!" was his cry. But the capture
of Canada was not so easy. Many generals failed,
and only Harrison and Perry made much headway in
defeating the British in Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

<p>When the time for peace came President Madison sent
Henry Clay and other noted Americans to Ghent, in

This treaty has since been called the "Treaty of Ghent."
Great Britain and America were both glad that peace
had come.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The conflict
over
Missouri</strong></div>

<p>From 1819 to 1821 Congress was debating over the
admission of Missouri as a slave state. The North opposed,
and the South favored, the admission of Missouri.
The excitement spread to the state legislatures and to the
people. Many meetings were held. Resolutions strongly
favoring, or strongly opposing, the admission of Missouri
as a slave state, were drawn up and voted upon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Missouri
Compromise</strong></div>

<p>Wise men thought the Union was in danger and Henry
Clay, by his eloquence, succeeded in getting Congress
to pass the famous Missouri Compromise. This resolution
provided that Missouri should be admitted as a
slave state, but that no other slave state north of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
line of 36 degrees 30 minutes should ever be admitted.
Both sides were pleased and the excitement died out.</p>

<p>We have seen how South Carolina threatened to refuse
to pay the tariff in 1832, and how President Jackson
hurried the army and the navy there to make her people
pay it, as the people of the other states were obliged to do.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The Compromise

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Henry

again</strong></div>

<p>Henry Clay came forward again and introduced the
Compromise Tariff Law. It was called a compromise
because it gave each side a part of what it wished. Calhoun
and other Carolinians favored it, because by this
law the tariff was reduced very greatly. It was carried
through Congress. The law made unnecessary the warlike
preparations of both the president and South
Carolina, and again Henry Clay was hailed by the people
as "pacificator" or peacemaker.</p>

But Henry Clay was not only
a peacemaker. He was now
a great statesman, and like
Hamilton and Jefferson he led
in forming a part of the people
into a political party. It
was called the Whig party.</p>

<p>In 1824, before there was
a Whig party, Clay ran for
president, but was beaten.
Again in 1832, just as the
new party was being formed,
he ran a second time. Although
he was beaten for the
presidency by Andrew Jackson,
he was the life and soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
of his party. It was his eloquence, the music of his
words, that made men Whigs.</p>

<p>On one occasion Clay spoke on the question of the
abolition of slavery. Some one said that this might
hurt his chances of being president. Clay replied:
"I had rather be right than be president."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Unfortunate

<p>Finally, in 1844, he was again the Whig candidate,

they nominated somebody else. When they had a poor
chance they nominated Henry Clay!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Dispute

<p>War with Mexico had come, and with it a great victory
for the American army. The treaty of peace with Mexico,
in 1848, gave the United States all the territory then
known as Alta (Upper) California and New Mexico.
But the North and South disputed over this territory.
The North said it must be free. The South said it must
be open to slavery. The quarrel grew so bitter that
many men thought the Union would be destroyed.</p>

joining in the vote. It was a proud moment for the old
man.</p>

<p>Now in the Senate, he offered the Compromise of 1850.
This bill contained a number of points in favor of the
slave states, and a number in favor of the free states.</p>

thing for the Senate to do. The people were not disappointed.
For two days the ringing words flowed on.
Under the excitement he was young again.</p>

<p>He pleaded with the North to give up some things for
the love of the Union; he pleaded with the South for peace.
He told them that all the territory the United States
had purchased had been purchased for all of them.
"War and the dissolution of the Union are identical."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A

<p>Congress finally passed the Compromise. Both political
parties pledged themselves to obey it. Public meetings

country rested for a time from the slavery question.</p>

<p><strong>153. A College Boy and a Young Lawyer.</strong> Daniel
Webster was born of good Puritan stock, in 1782, in New
Hampshire. He was a very weakly child. No one
dreamed that one day he would have an iron-like body.
Daniel spent much of his time playing in the woods and
fields. He loved the birds and beasts that he found there.
He went to school, but the schoolmasters were not very
learned, and Daniel could read better than most of them.
The teamsters, stopping to water their horses, were glad
to hear him read. He went to work in an old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
sawmill, but he read books even there in odd moments
of time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Webster

Exeter
Academy</strong></div>

<p>One day in spring his father took him to Exeter
Academy to prepare for college. The boys laughed at
his rustic dress and manners. The timid little fellow
was greatly hurt by their scorn.</p>

<p>He finally entered Dartmouth College at the age of
fifteen. He was simple, natural, and full of affection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The best

<div class="sidenote"><strong>He loved

<p>Webster was the best student at Dartmouth. He still
kept the reading habit. The students liked him. They
had a feeling that he would amount to something some
day. At this time he was tall and thin, with high cheek
bones. His eyes were deep set, and his voice was low
and musical in its tones. He loved to speak, even then.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen Webster gave the Fourth of
July oration in his college town. The speech was full
of the love of country and of the Union, then in its first
days of trial.</p>

<p>He never forgot his father's sacrifice in sending him to

taught school in order that he might help his parents
send his elder brother

studied law.
But he longed to finish
his law studies
in Boston. Finally
good fortune put him
in the office of Christopher

man, a great lawyer,
and a statesman. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
his office Daniel Webster studied until he was given the
right to practice law.</p>

him to take a life partner, the beautiful and accomplished
Grace Fletcher, the daughter of a minister. She made
a delightful home for him and their children.</p>

the approach of the War of 1812 drew him into politics.
He was elected to Congress, and took his seat in 1813.
Henry Clay was Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Webster's most important speech was in favor of a war
carried on by the navy: "If the war must be continued,
go to the ocean. There the united wishes and exertions
of the nation will go with you. Even our party divisions
cease at the water's edge."</p>

he looked larger

<p><strong>154. The Greatest Statesman of his Time.</strong> Hayne
had spoken against a protective tariff and in favor of
nullification. Webster felt called upon to reply. He
denied the right of a state to nullify a law of Congress,
and said that nullification was another name for secession.
He closed his great speech with these words: "When
my eyes shall be turned to behold, for the last time, the
sun in heaven, may I not see him shining on the broken
and dishonored fragments of a once glorious Union ...
but may I see our flag with not a stripe erased or polluted,
nor a single star obscured ... but everywhere spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
all over in characters of living light, blazing on its ample
folds, as they float over the sea and over the land ...
that sentiment, dear to
every American heart&mdash;Liberty
<em>and</em> Union, now
and forever, one and inseparable!"</p>

<p>This speech made Daniel
Webster immortal. It
did more; it fired the heart
of every lover of his country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Opposes

<p>We saw how South Carolina
went on toward nullification,

the difficulty the best way
she could.</p>

<p>It was a sad day when President Harrison died, after
being in office just one month. John Tyler, of Virginia,

not accept measures which Congress had passed. Daniel
Webster left the cabinet after a time because he disliked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the way Tyler was doing. He went back to the United

great Compromise of 1850.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>His
speech
on the
Compromise</strong></div>

<p>On March 7, Webster made his speech on the Compromise,
entitled "For the Union and the Constitution."
It was an appeal to all persons to stand by the Constitution
and the Union. In blaming both the North and
the South, much to the surprise of everybody, he blamed
the North more than the South.</p>

<p>Because he did this, many of his supporters in the
North, especially those in New England, turned their
backs upon him. Webster was an old man now. Ever
since 1832 he had looked forward to being nominated
for the presidency, but his party always took some
other man. His last days were made bitter and unhappy
by the thought that some old friends had forsaken him.</p>

must have made his heart leap with gratitude, for the
praise of friends is pleasant. But men saw he was not

where he died, October 24, 1852, the greatest figure in

it was because the law was too dry for him, or perhaps
because he was soon elected to the legislature of

be differences between the North and the South. He
said the southern people, using slave labor, would raise
more tobacco and cotton than they needed, and that the
tariff was hurtful to the South. That the northern
people, using free labor, would manufacture all kinds of
things, and that the tariff would be helpful to them.
This document took the ground that between the North
and the South there always would be a conflict of interests.
The South was devoted to agriculture, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
North to manufacturing. The South had slave and the
North free labor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>South

<p>Therefore, Calhoun concluded that to protect the
South from the North a state has the right to nullify
a law of Congress. A state has this right, because the
state is above the nation. The states made the Constitution.
He believed that nullification was a means of
saving the country from secession.</p>

<p>South Carolina took the fatal step, and nullified the
tariffs. This decision was to take effect February 1, 1833,
provided the United States did not do something before
that time to lower the tariff.</p>

<p><strong>157. Opposed to the Abolitionists.</strong> The people who
wished to do away with slavery entirely were called Abolitionists.
The Abolitionists stirred Calhoun deeply by
petitions in favor of abolishing slavery in the District of
Columbia. He declared that "the petitions are a foul
slander on nearly one half of the states of the Union....
The object is to humble and debase us in our own estimation ...
to blast our reputation. This is the (manner)
in which they are (trying) abolition ... and now is the
time for all opposed to them to meet the attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>Not many in the Senate agreed with Calhoun then. In

<p><strong>158. The Backwoodsman Who Became President.</strong>
Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, February 12,
1809. His parents
were so poor that
they hardly knew
that they were
poor. When he
was seven years
old his family
crossed the Ohio
River and settled
in Indiana. There
they found a place
in the deep, dark forest, in the southern part of the state,
and began to build a cabin for a home. Abe worked hard
to help build it. It was not much of a house&mdash;only fourteen
feet square. One side was left out, and here they
built the fire. It was not very warm in winter and not
very cool in summer. The hard ground was the floor.</p>

<p>The father was a sort of carpenter, and out of rough
timbers he made a table and some three-legged stools.
He also made the bedsteads, which consisted of poles
driven into the wall.</p>

<p>In the loft of the cabin Abe made himself a bed of
leaves. Every night he climbed into the loft by means
of wooden pins driven into the wall. He was busy
helping cut down trees and burning them to make room
for a patch of corn and pumpkins.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE GRAVE OF NANCY HANKS LINCOLN</p></div>
</div>

<p>The lad and his sister roasted the ears of young corn
over the fire. The ripe corn was ground into meal
from which corn bread
was made. This was
baked in the ashes or
on a board in front of
a bed of red-hot coals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>As a

<p>The woods, great
thick woods for miles
on all sides of them,
were broken only here
and there by a "clearing."
In these forests Abe went hunting with a gun on
his shoulder. He often came back laden with squirrels,
wild turkeys, and other game.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>His
mother's
death</strong></div>

<p>They were living in the cabin when Abe's mother
sickened and died. He was broken-hearted. She had
taught him what little he knew. Her last words to him
were: "Try to live as I have taught you and to love
your Heavenly Father."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lincoln's
tribute
to his
mother</strong></div>

<p>Many years after, when he became famous, he said:
"All that I am or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother."
She was put in a coffin roughly cut out of logs by the same
tools that had made their furniture, and laid to rest in
a corner of the clearing. Long years afterward a good
man put a stone over the grave, with this inscription:
"Nancy Hanks Lincoln, the mother of President Lincoln,
died October 5, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1818, aged 35 years."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lincoln

<p>After a year his father went back to Kentucky to look
about for a wife. He found a widow, named Sarah
Bush Johnston, and married her. He had known her
before he met Nancy Hanks. She was thrifty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
industrious, and her bedding and other household goods
filled a four-horse wagon.</p>

<p>Before winter came she made her husband put a good
floor, and a door, and windows in the cabin. She took
charge of Abe and his sister, and made them "look a
little more human." She put good clothes on the
children and put them to sleep in comfortable beds.</p>

Progress</cite>, a history of the United States, and Weem's
<cite>Life of Washington</cite>. He borrowed the <cite>Revised Statutes of
Indiana</cite>. These were all solid
books, good for a young boy

<p>Young Lincoln was soon able to do a "man's labor,"

of brothers, sisters, and cousins, his

peace. Abe was the great story-teller
of the family.</p>

<p>They built a cabin on the north fork of the river.
With the help of John Hanks, young Lincoln plowed

As he turned away he said to a friend: "If ever I get a
chance to hit that thing, I'll hit it hard." He did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
then dream of the mighty blow he would one day strike.
After his return from New Orleans, he became a clerk
in a store.</p>

<p>One day a woman gave Lincoln six cents too much.
That very evening he walked several miles to find her
and give back the money. At another time Lincoln
found that he had not given a woman as much tea as
she paid for. He went in search of her and gave her

<div class="caption"><p>LINCOLN AS A CIRCUIT RIDER</p></div>
</div>

<p>In 1837 the legislature passed a set of resolutions in
favor of slavery and condemning the Abolitionists. Lincoln
could not
stand this. He
and one other
man signed a
protest declaring
that slavery was
founded on "injustice
and bad
policy."</p>

<p>Lincoln was
reëlected to the
legislature seven
times. He generally
got more
votes than other
men on the ticket
because the
people liked his
quaint sayings
and his unpretending
manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lincoln

<p>In the meantime,
after three or four years of study, he was given a
license to practice law. He made it a rule never to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
a case which he believed to be wrong. He was a successful
lawyer, but the road to fame by way of the law was a
slow one. It gave Lincoln a chance to engage in politics,
as we have already seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>His taste
for public
speaking</strong></div>

<p>He liked "stump speaking." He liked to go about
the country from one speaking place to another, or to
travel from one county to another to meet the different
sessions of the courts. He spoke for what he believed
to be the truth. He was always in earnest, and made
his hearers feel that he was sincere.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Speaks

<p>In 1840 he was one of Harrison's orators, and in 1844

Clay, his favorite among the great men, for the presidency.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lincoln

<p>In 1846 the Whigs of Springfield, where he was then
living, put Lincoln forward for Congress, and succeeded
in getting him elected. He was not in favor of the war
with Mexico, then going on, and was not selected to run
again. Lincoln returned to Springfield, and began the
practice of law with greater success than ever before.</p>

<p>When Senator Douglas of Illinois, in 1854, carried the
Kansas-Nebraska Bill through Congress, anti-slavery
men all over the nation raised a storm of indignation.
This bill repealed the Missouri Compromise, which had
stood for thirty years, and threw the territories open to
slavery.</p>

Peoria, a little later. Again Lincoln met Douglas'
arguments. People began to talk of Lincoln as the next
United States senator. More and more,
popular opinion in the state began to
turn toward Lincoln.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Nominated
for
United
States
senator</strong></div>

<p>Accordingly, in 1858, at Springfield,
the Republicans in convention named
Lincoln for United States senator. He
made a speech to the Republicans in
which he said that this country cannot
remain half slave and half free&mdash;that it
must become all slave or all free.</p>

<p>This called every man to face a new question. No
greater question could be raised. Some friends of Lincoln
pleaded with him not to say that the country could
not remain half slave and half free. "I had rather be
defeated with that expression in my speech than to be
victorious without it," said Lincoln.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lincoln
challenges
Douglas</strong></div>


<p><strong>162. The Lincoln-Douglas Debates.</strong> Douglas attacked
this speech, and Lincoln challenged him to hold
several joint debates before the people of Illinois. Seven
debates were arranged, in which Douglas insisted upon
opening and closing four.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>People
come
from far
away to
hear the
debates</strong></div>

<p>The people of Illinois were mainly farmers in 1858.
They traveled long distances to hear these giants debate
the question of slavery. Some of them were several
days coming and going&mdash;in wagons, on horseback, or on
foot. The newspapers in the larger cities sent men to
listen to these debates, and take down the words used
by Lincoln and Douglas. The editors knew the people
were anxiously waiting to read what these men had to
say about slavery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The fatal
answer</strong></div>

<p>"Can the people of a ... Territory, in any lawful
way, against the wish of any citizen ... exclude
slavery?" Lincoln asked. "Yes," said Douglas. That
was a fatal answer. For, by this answer, Douglas lost
the support of the Democrats of the South, although he
held the Democrats of Illinois. He could still be senator,
but he could never be president.</p>

<p>The debates went on. "I do not perceive," said
Lincoln, "that because the white man is to have the
superior position, the negro should be denied
everything ... there is no reason in the world why the negro
is not entitled to all the natural rights [named] in the
Declaration of Independence ... I agree with Judge
Douglas, he [the negro] is not my equal in many respects&mdash;certainly
not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual
endowments. But, in the right to eat the bread,
without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand
earns, he is my equal, and the equal of Judge Douglas,
and the equal of every living man."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lincoln

<p>These debates made Lincoln widely known. He
accepted invitations to speak in Ohio, New York, and
New England.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lincoln
the rail-splitter</strong></div>

<p>In May, 1860, the Republicans of Illinois met in state
convention. Lincoln was there. The people picked
him up, lifted him over their heads, and placed him on
the platform. The cheering was loud. Just at this
moment John Hanks came into the hall carrying two
fence rails, with the Stars and Stripes mounted between
them, bearing in large words the following: "Taken
from a lot made by Abraham Lincoln and John Hanks
in the Sangamon Bottom in the year 1830." The people
stood up and cheered, and threw their hats high and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
shouted for Lincoln, the "rail-splitter." He made them
a speech. The convention then and there named him
as the choice of the Republican party of Illinois for the
next President of the United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The candidate

<p><strong>163. Lincoln President.</strong> A few weeks later Abraham
Lincoln was nominated in Chicago by the National Convention
of the Republican party for the presidency.
Just as the passage of Douglas' Kansas-Nebraska Bill
killed the old Whig party, so the debates between Lincoln
and Douglas split the Democratic party into a northern
and a southern wing.</p>

<p>Douglas was nominated by the northern wing, and

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>During the fall and winter, seven southern states left
the Union, and set up a government called the "Confederate
States of America." They had their government
all in running order before Lincoln left Springfield.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Bound

Washington</strong></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>At Independence
Hall</strong></div>

<p>In February, 1861, Lincoln said good-by to the people
of Springfield, and started for Washington to take his
seat as president. The people were bound to see him and
hear his voice and shake his hand. Along the route
there were cheers, bonfires, and military parades with
miles of marching men. At Philadelphia he raised a
flag over Independence Hall. He made a touching
speech in regard to the men of the Revolution who had
sat in that hall, and pledged himself to abide by the
principles of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The inauguration</strong></div>

<p>On March 4, with soldiers guarding the capitol, Lincoln
read his inaugural address and took the oath of office
which all presidents before him had taken. This speech
was listened to with the greatest interest. It was now
plain to everybody that Lincoln meant to fight, if fighting
were necessary to save the Union.</p>

<p>In April Confederates fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston
Harbor, South Carolina. After awful hardships,
Colonel Anderson and his men surrendered the fort to
the Confederate troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The call
for men</strong></div>

<p>Lincoln immediately sent forth the call for seventy-five
thousand men. He made it a call to save the Union
which Jackson, Webster, and Clay had done so much to
save. War had come&mdash;civil war, the most dreadful kind
of war. Four more states left the Union, and joined the
Confederate States. But the slave states of Maryland,
Kentucky, and Missouri remained with the Union.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Blockade
of Confederate
States</strong></div>

<p>While the Union troops were gathering and drilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
in Washington, Lincoln declared a blockade of the ports
of the Confederate States. He saw that if he closed the
ports of the South he could prevent the shipment of cotton
to Europe and so keep the Confederacy from getting
supplies in exchange for the cotton. This was a heavy
blow to the Confederates.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The "Merrimac"
and the

<p>The South depended on the <em>Merrimac</em> to break the
blockade. The <em>Merrimac</em> was a wooden war vessel
which had been covered with a double coat of iron. It
had a great iron beak with which it could ram wooden
vessels. The <em>Merrimac</em> moved to attack the Union fleet,
which was stationed in Hampton Roads. The shot fired
from the Union vessels and from the shore batteries
had no more effect on the iron coat of the <em>Merrimac</em> than
hail on a tin roof. She sank one wooden war vessel
and set another on fire. What was to hinder her from
going up the Potomac and bombarding Washington?</p>

reached Hampton Roads that night and took position to
defend the Union fleet from
the <em>Merrimac</em>. The next
morning the two ironclads
met in battle. It was a
battle of giants. "Why do
you stop firing?" asked an
officer of one of the gunners
on the <em>Merrimac</em>. "I
can do her as much damage
by snapping my thumb
at her every two minutes
and a half," was the
reply.</p>

<p>It was a drawn battle.
Washington was safe. The
South could not break the
blockade. This battle
between the <em>Merrimac</em> and
the <em>Monitor</em> changed the navies of the world. Wooden
war vessels now gave place to iron vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>McClellan

<p>Meantime great battles were also being fought on
land. In the East the Union army under General McClellan
had been hurled back in an attack on Richmond.
The Confederates under General Lee, in an attempt to
invade the North, had been forced to retreat.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Grant

<p>In the West events of equal importance were taking
place. The Union troops under General Grant defeated
the Confederates in many battles in Kentucky and

under Captain David Farragut, Grant captured the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Confederate strongholds along the Mississippi River,
and so cut the Confederacy in two.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Slavery
question
to the
front</strong></div>

<p>Lincoln had declared the war was to be fought to save
the Union and not to get rid of slavery. But as the war
went on, the slavery question would keep coming up.
The Confederates used the slaves to build forts, cook for
the army, and to do other work. Thus the slave took
the place of the white soldier. Other slaves raised food
supplies and cared for the women. In this way the slaves
were constantly being used to help fight against the Union.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lincoln
and the
South</strong></div>


<p><strong>165. Andrew Johnson as President.</strong> Before the war
Lincoln had begun the reconstruction of the South. He
did not admit that the Confederate
states had ever
really left the Union. Whenever
one-tenth of the voters
in a state would take an
oath of loyalty to the Union,
he allowed them to set up a
new government. Lincoln
then recognized this as the
regular state government.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Johnson
a Southerner</strong></div>

<p>Lincoln did not live to
apply his wise and moderate
rule to more than a few
states. Even here he met
with opposition from Congress.
Andrew Johnson, who
succeeded him as President, was a Southerner, though a
stout Unionist. He was honest, but rude and harsh in
his behavior.</p>

<p>Johnson tried to carry out Lincoln's plans for reconciling
the defeated states. But he did not consult Congress
before he began. Congress felt that the President was
trying to override its power. It made much more harsh
conditions for re-admitting the southern states.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
President
and
Congress
quarrel</strong></div>

<p>The quarrel between the President and Congress ended
in an impeachment trial. Johnson retained his presidency
by only one vote. Whether or not this trial was
deserved may be a question. There can be no doubt,
however, but that in dealing with foreign countries Andrew
Johnson's motives were wise and patriotic as well.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Maximilian
"Emperor
of
Mexico"</strong></div>

<p>Mexico had long owed certain debts to England,
France, and Spain. The French emperor, Napoleon III,
determined to make these debts an excuse for extending
his power. He sent soldiers to Mexico, and used them to
set up an Austrian archduke, Maximilian, as Emperor of
Mexico. President Johnson sent American soldiers to
the Rio Grande, and the French forces were withdrawn.
Maximilian had now no support and later was shot.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Alaska
Purchase</strong></div>

<p>In 1867 Johnson purchased Alaska from Russia for
$7,200,000. Thus one more European power gave up its
possessions in the New World.</p>


<p><strong>166. The Progress of Reconstruction.</strong> Contentment
of mind and regular, peaceful growth of trade and business
did not return to the South until long after Johnson's
presidency. Congress had little understanding of the
difficulties with which it was faced. Under its reconstruction
the life of the South was for a time cruelly
unsettled. At last the old southern leaders themselves
restored order. Then they governed much as before.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What
Lincoln's
death
meant to
the South</strong></div>

<p>Lincoln had earned the respect of the South, for he was
a leader great enough to be generous in victory. He
might have checked the misrule which nearly ruined the
industries of the South, and created more lasting bitterness
than the war. The South suffered as great a loss
as the North in the death of Lincoln.</p>

California as a captain, but very soon resigned, and when
the Civil War
broke out in 1861
he was working as
a clerk in his
father's store at
Galena, Illinois.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>His

<p><strong>168. A Great
General.</strong> When
Lincoln's call for
seventy-five thousand
men startled
the country, Grant
was made chairman of a meeting at Galena called to raise
a company of soldiers. He then went to Springfield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
where the governor set him to work drilling soldiers and
getting them ready for the war. After a time he became
colonel of a regiment. A
further promotion followed
which made him a brigadier-general
in command of
several regiments. Later
still he rose to be major-general,
in command of an
army.</p>

<p>Early in the war it was
seen that in order to conquer
the Confederacy it
must be split in two by
gaining possession of the
Mississippi River. As a
part of the great campaign
with this end in view, we
find Brigadier-General Grant directing the attacks on
Fort Henry and Fort Donelson. These places were less
than ten miles apart, in western Tennessee.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Captures
Forts
Henry
and
Donelson</strong></div>

<p>With the help of Commodore Foote and his gunboats,
Grant easily captured Fort Henry. To take Fort Donelson
was not so easy. The Confederates tried to break
through the right wing of Grant's army. After hard
fighting they were driven back, and General Buckner
asked what terms Grant would give if they surrendered.
To this General Grant replied that he would consider "no
terms but an unconditional and immediate
surrender ... I propose to move immediately upon your
works." This answer has become famous.</p>

<p>The surrender of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
the Confederates to move back their line of defense.
After winning the two days' battle at Pittsburg Landing,
General Grant turned his attention to the Mississippi
River. As long as the Mississippi remained open to
the southern forces, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas
could send food supplies to the Confederates on the east
side of the river. This General Grant wanted to stop,
so, early in 1863, he moved southward to take Vicksburg.
He beat the Confederates in the field and drove them into
Vicksburg. The siege of the city lasted seven weeks.
No one could slip in or out. Meat and bread grew scarce.
The houses were knocked to pieces by cannon balls, and
people found shelter in cellars and caves.</p>

<p>On the Fourth of July, 1863, Vicksburg, with Pemberton's

<p>During this campaign in the lower Mississippi country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
a large Confederate army had marched north from Virginia,
across Maryland into Pennsylvania. This army,
under General Robert E. Lee, had won its way as far as
Gettysburg. Here, at the end of a great three days'
battle, the Confederates were decisively beaten; this defeat
came on July 3, and on the very next day came the
news that
far-away
Vicksburg
had surrendered
to
Grant. After

at Murfreesboro,

defeated at
Chickamauga,
and then
cooped up in
the town of

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lieutenant-general</strong></div>


<p><strong>169. Great Commander of the Union Armies.</strong> President
Lincoln saw that General Grant was a great soldier.
He sent for him to come to Washington and made him
lieutenant-general in command of all the armies of the
United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
"Wilderness"</strong></div>

<p>Grant took command at once. His first great object
was to capture Lee's army. The shortest way to Lee's
army lay through the "Wilderness," a part of the country
lying south of the upper part of the Rapidan, in Virginia,
and covered with a thick forest of tangled underbrush.
The route was dangerous. But into the "Wilderness"
Grant plunged with his great army. General Lee was
there with his troops. The fighting began. For a
month it was almost constant charging, back and forth,
and there were long lists of dead and wounded. Grant
moved his army southward and nearer Richmond. Lee
met him in the bloody battles of Spottsylvania and Cold
Harbor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Petersburg
taken</strong></div>

<p>Then Grant crossed the James River, south of Richmond,
and began the attack on Petersburg. This place
was taken in the spring of 1865.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Richmond
given up</strong></div>

<p>General Lee told the Confederate president, Jefferson
Davis, that he could hold Richmond no longer. He tried
to get his army away, but the men were weak from hard
fighting, and Sheridan, with his cavalry, was too quick
for him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lee surrenders

<p>General Grant wrote to General Lee suggesting that he
surrender, and thus prevent the loss of more lives. Lee
agreed, and the papers were signed April 9, 1865, at Appomattox
Court House. No more generous terms were
ever given than those granted to Lee and his men.</p>

<p>After the war was over General Grant served for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Robert

<p><strong>171. The Great General of the Confederacy.</strong> Robert
E. Lee was born in Virginia in 1807. He went to school
at Alexandria, where George Washington once lived, and
became a cadet at the United States Military Academy
at West Point.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>In

<p>In the war with Mexico Lee earned honor and fame.
He rose rapidly in rank. Starting as captain, he became
major, lieutenant-colonel, and then colonel. When the
Mexican War was over, he took charge of the Military
Academy at West Point. After three years, he decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
to give up the work at West Point and go West to fight
the Indians.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lee goes

<p>About this time the people began to insist that, in the
United States, slavery must be given up. Even the
army officers and men quarreled about it. Lee believed
in the Union and did not want the South to leave it.
But when Virginia followed other slave states out of the
Union and into the Confederacy, Lee went with his
native state.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>In command

<p>When the war began, Lee, as general, had command
of the Virginia troops. After the battle of Fair Oaks, in

Lee took charge of the army defending Richmond.</p>

<p><strong>172. Lee Fights Battle after Battle.</strong> Lee at once
attacked the Union army which was trying to take
Richmond. In a seven days' battle he forced McClellan,
the Union general, to retreat. He then struck the army
of Pope a fatal blow and marched with his victorious
soldiers into Maryland. A great battle was fought at
Antietam (1862) and Lee returned to Virginia. He won
two great victories at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.
In the latter battle he lost Stonewall Jackson, his
best general. After this, his army rested and ranks
filled, General Lee moved rapidly through Maryland
and into Pennsylvania. The North became alarmed, but
a great Union army was already hurrying to meet the
Confederate forces.</p>

the killed, wounded, and missing on both
sides&mdash;were lost at Gettysburg.</p>

went back across the Potomac, never to invade the North
again. From then onward, little was done until, in
1864, General Grant took command of all the Union
forces. Then followed three great battles&mdash;the "Wilderness,"
so called because it was fought in a thick forest
of tangled underbrush lying in Virginia just south of the
upper portion of the Rapidan; Spottsylvania, fought
near the Spottsylvania courthouse a little farther southward,
and Cold Harbor, fought a few miles northeast

<p>General Lee's troops were wearing out. There were no

Food and clothing became scarce, and other supplies

immediately put Joseph E. Johnston back in command
of his old army in the West, but it was too late.</p>

<p>At an early age he entered Kenyon College, Ohio.
Here he was a leader among his fellows, not only in college
affairs, but in his daily work in
the classroom. He graduated
with first honors in his class.</p>

<p>For his after-college work
Hayes decided to choose the
law, and graduated from Harvard
Law School. He was just
beginning to win success when
Lincoln's call to arms aroused
the men of the North. It
seemed terrible for northern
men and southern men to fight
against each other, but it had
to be done to save the Union.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Becomes
a general</strong></div>

<p>Hayes volunteered and was
made a major in command. By his fine work as an
officer in caring for his men and in bravery on the field of
battle, he won the title of general. While he was still
fighting, the people at home, looking for a high-minded,
honorable man for congress, nominated Hayes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Refuses
to leave
his post
to campaign</strong></div>

<p>His supporters sent for him to come home and canvass
for votes. He would not go. He said: "An officer fit
for duty who, at such a time as this, would abandon his
post to electioneer for a seat in Congress, ought to be
scalped." Hayes remained at his post and was elected
by a large majority.</p>

<p>Hayes had become known to all the people of his state
and they wanted him for governor. So friendly was he
toward all whether high or low, so honest was he that
three times the people chose him to be their governor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1876 the Republicans of the nation selected him to
be their candidate for the high office of president. The
Democratic candidate was a man of very high reputation,
Samuel J. Tilden of New York. He was known as a
fighter for honesty and against wrongdoing in public office.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Contest
over the

<p>Unfortunately, the politicians aroused bitter feeling
between the North and the South in this campaign.
When it was seen that Hayes was winner by only one
vote, there were threats of "civil war." But luckily
Tilden did not lose his head, and his party, following his
advice, accepted the result.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Generous
toward
the South</strong></div>

<p>Hayes decided to take the Union soldiers out of the
South. The radical Republicans opposed this action,
but the majority of the people in the North favored it.
The southern people were happy, because now they might
manage their elections to suit themselves.</p>

<p>President Hayes also placed a southern man in his
cabinet, and this, too, helped along the good feeling between
the North and the South.</p>

<p>We can see now that the return of good feeling between
the North and the South was necessary, but it was not
so easily seen then. Now we can say that President
Hayes was a noble and far-seeing statesman when he
offered the "olive branch" to the South.</p>

White House. The temperance people were happy, but
others were not, especially the ministers of foreign countries
who had always been in the habit of using wine on
social occasions. A great cry was raised throughout the
country, but Lucy Webb Hayes stood her ground.</p>

<h3>JAMES A. GARFIELD AND CHESTER A. ARTHUR</h3>

<div class="caption"><p>JAMES A. GARFIELD</p>

<p><em>After a photograph by E. Bierstadt</em></p></div>
</div>


<p><strong>176. The Towpath that Led to the Presidency.</strong> Like
Lincoln, the second of our "martyr Presidents" started
life in a log cabin. Garfield
was born near Cleveland,
Ohio (1831). His parents
were poor and his father
died while Garfield was yet
an infant. Garfield's mother
was brave and held her little
family together. The children
did not have much chance
to go to school. Life to them
was a hard struggle.</p>

<p>When James reached the
age of fifteen, he began driving
mules on the towpath of
a canal running from Cleveland
to Portsmouth. This
was the time when canal boats carried both freight and
passengers. The towpath was a hard "school," but had
many good lessons for a boy wise enough to keep out of
mischief.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Determined
to
have an
education</strong></div>

<p>He had his heart set on an education. He went to
school long enough to be able to teach school. He shared
his earnings with his mother. Teaching only sharpened his
appetite for an education. For a time he went to Hiram
College and afterward became a teacher there. He
loved Hiram College because it was supported by the
Church of the Disciples, of which he was a member. He
finished his education at Williams College.</p>

<p>When Lincoln called for men for the war, Garfield, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
thousands of others, volunteered. He became an officer
and did his work so well that he was promoted to be
major general. Like Hayes, he was elected to Congress
while in the army, fighting its battles. Again and again,
the people of his district sent him to Congress, and
finally in 1880 the legislature of his native state made him
a United States senator.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>War,
Congress,
and the
Presidency</strong></div>

<p>Garfield was a wonderful orator. Before the Republicans,
gathered in Chicago, he placed the name of John
Sherman in nomination for the presidency. So great was
this speech that the convention turned from all the men

<p>Garfield won the presidency before he had a chance to
take his seat as United States senator. After delivering
his inaugural address to the vast crowd gathered, he
turned and kissed his mother.</p>

<p>The Republicans had promised to make new rules about
men appointed to office. They declared that men should
not hold office just because they had worked for the party
in power, but that they should pass an examination to
find out whether or not they were fit for the position.</p>

<p>While Garfield was leaving Washington to attend the
Fourth of July celebration at Williams College, he was
shot by a half-crazy, disappointed office seeker. He
lived until September. Few young people can now understand
how the American people felt during this time.
They learned to hate the "spoils system." Garfield's
death sealed its fate.</p>

<p><strong>177. Arthur Becomes President.</strong> Chester A. Arthur
was thought to be a "politician" merely, but he proved
to be a good president. He began to build up a strong

<p>Since the days of the Civil War, we had been too busy
with affairs at home to think much about the need of a
navy. But beginning with
President Arthur's administration
we have increased its
size from time to time, until
during the war with Spain,
our people came to feel the
navy's value.</p>

<p>Under Arthur the spoils
system received its first
deadly blow when Congress
passed and Arthur signed a
bill establishing the merit
system. By this system, men
are appointed to office only
after they have proved their
fitness by an examination. Under it men cannot be
turned out of office except for just cause.</p>

<h3>GROVER CLEVELAND</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Early
life</strong></div>


<p><strong>178. A Man Who Was Twice President.</strong> Grover
Cleveland saw the light of day in the old state of New
Jersey in 1837. While he was yet a boy his parents moved
to central New York. Here he received a common school
education. He was a good pupil and made friends with
boys who loved honesty and fair play. His parents were
poor and could not send him to college. He was always
sorry for this and tried to make up for it by hard study.
The lives of men great in history and literature were what
he liked best to read.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">

<div class="caption"><p>GROVER CLEVELAND</p>

<p><em>From a photograph by Bell</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>After going to Buffalo, young Cleveland entered upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
the study of law. He studied long upon the fine points
of the law. In time he became one of the ablest lawyers,
not only in Buffalo, but in the
State of New York. The fact
that young Cleveland was
chosen sheriff of Erie County
shows that a great many people
already looked upon him as a
courageous man.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lawyer,
mayor,
and
governor</strong></div>

<p>When Buffalo needed a mayor
who was not afraid to do his
duty, the people elected this
man who had been a good
sheriff.</p>

<p>The people of the State of
New York wanted a man of the
Cleveland type for governor.
He carried the state by a great
majority. He was a great governor as he had been a
great mayor. He was honest and straightforward, and
treated all men alike. Long before his time as governor
was up, the people began to talk of him for president.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Runs
against
Blaine</strong></div>

<p>Cleveland ran against a widely known and popular
man, James G. Blaine of Maine. But the Republicans
split and Cleveland won. The Democrats were happy
over the result, for this was the first time they had elected
a president since 1856.</p>

<p>The Republicans had kept a high tariff ever since the
Civil War. The result was that our treasury at Washington
was full of money. Cleveland sent a message to
Congress asking that the tariff be cut down, but the high-tariff
Democrats joined the Republicans in supporting it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>Cleveland had made many enemies in his own party by
refusing to appoint unfit men to office. When, therefore,
he ran for president again in 1888, he was beaten by
Senator Harrison of Indiana.</p>

<p>But four years later, in 1892, he defeated Harrison and
again became president.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
panic of
1893</strong></div>


<p><strong>179. The Panic of 1893.</strong> Cleveland had hardly taken
his seat as President when hard times struck the country.
Business men and laborers suffered greatly. They could
not pay their debts. Men, women, and children suffered
for want of bread.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
great
railroad
strike</strong></div>

<p>The Pullman Car Company of Chicago cut down the
wages of its workmen. The men called a strike which
finally extended over half the states of the Union.</p>

<p>Chicago was the center of the strike. Hundreds of
cars were burned and lives were threatened. It was
impossible to carry the United States mail or freight from
one state to another. Grover Cleveland ordered United
States soldiers to Chicago to keep the mails going and the
freight running. This broke the back of the strike.
Cleveland had shown how to settle strikes in a new way.</p>

<p>Cleveland served twice as President and after his second
term of office he moved to Princeton, New Jersey, the seat
of Princeton University. Here he became famous for
his lectures given before the student body.</p>

<h3>BENJAMIN HARRISON</h3>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/i_350a.jpg" width="360" height="540" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>BENJAMIN HARRISON</p>

<p><em>From a photograph by L. Alman</em></p></div>
</div>


<p><strong>180. A General Who Became President.</strong> Early in
our national history it had happened that the son of a
President of the United States had also become President.
In 1833 a boy was born in Ohio, the grandson
of a President, who was also to gain this high position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
His grandfather was William Henry Harrison, who
was elected President in the stirring campaign of
1840. His parents named him
Benjamin.</p>

<p>Young Harrison, a happy and
well-born boy, received his education
in the public schools.
He entered Miami University
at an early age and graduated
at eighteen.</p>

<p>Harrison, like so many of our
other presidents, studied law.
He was very soon admitted to
the bar, and in 1854 he went to
live in the Hoosier State at
Indianapolis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Enters
the
army</strong></div>

<p>He answered the call to arms.
He was made a lieutenant, but
had hardly learned his duties before he was promoted
to be captain of a company of one hundred men. Hardly
a month passed before an order came making him a colonel
of a regiment of a thousand men. He led this regiment
until the last days of the war, and the boys were proud of
"Colonel Ben."</p>

<p>For personal bravery and for skill in handling his men
in one of the battles in Georgia, he was made major
general.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Active
in
politics</strong></div>

<p>After the war Harrison returned to the law. In political
campaigns he was much sought after to speak in all
parts of the state.</p>

<p>He did not accept office until he was elected United
States senator in 1881. Senator Harrison was nominated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
for the presidency in 1888. He set the example of making
speeches "on his front porch" to admiring crowds who
came from different states.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A picturesque
campaign</strong></div>

<p>In this campaign the Democrats pointed to Harrison
as a man who wore his "grandfather's hat." The Republicans
made this campaign like that of 1840. There
was great enthusiasm, big wagons carrying log cabins
with raccoons and barrels of hard cider, great balls rolling
on, and happy songs. Tippecanoe clubs were formed in
all parts of the country. The result was the election of
Harrison.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Pensions
and the
tariff</strong></div>

<p>Under President Harrison a tariff law was passed with a
reciprocity agreement. By this arrangement, the United
States agreed to reduce its tariff if other nations would
reduce theirs. President Harrison had a warm spot in
his heart for the old soldiers, and he signed with pleasure
a new pension law.</p>

<p>The farmers and the silver men of the West were becoming
dissatisfied with the action of Congress. In 1890
their forces elected several new Congressmen, and in the
next year formed the People's party. Most of the votes
of this party were drawn from the Republican side,
hence in the next campaign Harrison was defeated by
Cleveland.</p>

roam the fields and woods surrounding Niles, his home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
town, or to fish in the fine streams near by. When he
was about nine years old his parents moved to Poland,
Ohio, where there were good
schools for children. McKinley
studied hard, and at seventeen
years of age entered Allegheny
College at Meadville, Pennsylvania.
But his health had never
been very good and he fell ill
from hard study. He returned
to Poland, and there a little later
he taught school.</p>

life was good for him, and when the war was over he was

<p><strong>182. Spanish Persecution in Cuba.</strong> Since the earliest
days of Spanish rule, Cuba had been discontented and
had engaged in frequent wars with Spain because of heavy
taxation and bad government. Again and again the
Cubans revolted, but they were not strong enough to succeed
and Spanish oppression continued. In 1895 the
people rose in a last desperate effort to free themselves.
To crush them Spain sent a large army under a cruel general.
Large numbers of unarmed Cubans&mdash;men, women,
and children&mdash;were gathered into camps guarded by
Spanish soldiers and cut off from food and other supplies.
Thousands died of starvation and disease.</p>

In 1894, under Spanish rule, there were only about 900

only about 60,000 pupils were on the rolls. Six years
later, under American rule, there were 3,550 public
schools, with 172,000 pupils enrolled. By the conduct

<h3>THEODORE ROOSEVELT, THE TYPICAL AMERICAN</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Of Dutch
descent</strong></div>


<p><strong>185. Theodore Roosevelt as a Boy.</strong> Although the son
of a rich man, Roosevelt both as boy and man was most
democratic. One of his forefathers, Klaes Martensen van
Roosevelt, came from Holland to New York in the
steerage of a sailing vessel, a most lowly way to travel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
This was long ago, before Peter Stuyvesant was governor
of New Netherland, as New York colony was then called.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THEODORE ROOSEVELT</p>

<p><em>From a photograph by Bell</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Young Roosevelt had
learned a few words of
an old Dutch baby-song.
When in South Africa,
he pleased the Dutch
settlers by repeating the
few words he still remembered.
The settlers
still teach this song to
their children, though
their forefathers left
Holland for that country
more than two hundred
and fifty years ago.</p>

<p>Roosevelt's mother
was a charming southern
woman, who was
true to the South in the Civil War; her brothers were
in the Confederate Navy. One night, as she was putting
the children to bed, Theodore broke out into a rather
loud prayer for the Union soldiers. The mother only
smiled.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Absence
of
sectional
bitterness</strong></div>

<p>The father stood for the Union and for Lincoln. He
helped fit out regiments and cared for the widow and the
orphan. But there was no quarreling in this home over
these differences. What a fine example to set before children!
No wonder Roosevelt could refer with pride, when
a man, to the heroic deeds of the Blue and the Gray.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What the
Roosevelt
children
did</strong></div>

<p>Theodore was a sickly boy. Hence he was sent to a
private school or had a tutor. The children spent their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
summers among the delights of a country home. They
had all sorts of frolicsome games. They had pets: cats,
dogs, rabbits, woodchucks, crows, and a Shetland pony.
They ran barefoot and joined their elders in playing at
haying, harvesting, and picking apples. In the fall they
climbed the hickory and the chestnut trees in search of
nuts. Sometimes they played "Indians," in real fashion,
by painting hands and faces with pokeberry juice!</p>

<p>But the children thought that by far the happiest
time was Christmas. Roosevelt declares that he never
knew another family to have so jolly a time at that
season of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Praises
father as
model
man</strong></div>

<p>Roosevelt makes a statement I wish every boy could
make: "My father was the best man I ever knew."
Roosevelt, the father, did not permit his children to
become selfish. Each was taught to divide his gifts&mdash;not
always an easy thing for older folks to do. In this
home the children were taught to avoid being cruel and
to practice kindness. Idleness was forbidden. The children
were kept busy doing interesting things. Neither
was young Roosevelt permitted to play the coward. He
was taught to face unpleasant things like a man. His
father could never stand a lie, even if it were only a
"white" one. There was no room in that home for the
coward or the bully.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Enters
Harvard</strong></div>

<p>At fifteen, after a year or more spent in Egypt, Palestine,
and Germany, Theodore came home a more enthusiastic
American than ever. He now began to prepare
for college. He entered Harvard in 1876. He made a
good but not a brilliant student. Throughout his course
he taught a mission Bible class. He would not be without
something to do even on Sunday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A boxing
match</strong></div>

<p>He graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors. Yet he
was not a "bookworm," but fond of all college sports.
He was a genuine sportsman without being "sporty,"
as a boxing match once proved. One day Roosevelt and
another student were having a hard fight. Students
crowded around. The battle was hot. Time was called.
Roosevelt promptly dropped his hands, while the other
fellow landed a smashing blow on Roosevelt's nose.
"Foul! foul!" shouted the students. "No! He did not
hear," cried Roosevelt, and warmly shook hands with
the offending student. How many boys can stand a
blow in the face and not get angry? Roosevelt could.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Fought
hard for
health</strong></div>

<p>Roosevelt had a resolute will, and he determined to
make himself stronger, so far as he could. He took boxing
lessons, and became skilled in this art. He rode horseback
in the chase. He took long tramps into the dark
woods of Maine. In the summer he went on canoe trips,
and in winter on long hikes on snowshoes.</p>

<p>This frail boy, through his determination, became a
man noted for his ruggedness and ceaseless energy. He
had a keen love of adventure. As a rancher, hunter and
explorer he met constant hardship and danger. But
Roosevelt welcomed it all as part of the game.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Beginnings
of
political
life</strong></div>


<p><strong>186. Enters Politics.</strong> He joined a local Republican
association in New York. His rich friends laughed at
him for joining hands with saloonkeepers and "ward
heelers." They would not do it, but this young democrat
did. He was nominated for the assembly. He
must now show his mettle. He began canvassing the
saloon vote. A saloonkeeper declared his license too
high. Roosevelt declared it too low; he said if elected
he would make it higher. In spite of opposition he won.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>Before he got through at Albany he learned that no
man could be a fearless leader whose moral character was
weak. Another lesson he learned was that a man must
act in office as if he were never to hold another. He
was elected three times to the assembly and made a name
for himself in fighting bad laws and demanding good ones.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<strong>Often

life of

on
ranches</strong></div>


<p><strong>187. Western Life.</strong> After this, Roosevelt spent a
number of years in the great Northwest. These years
added to his strength and helped him become finely
developed both physically and morally. In the time he
spent on the ranches of this wild region and on a Dakota
ranch of his own, he lived as a cowboy. He was a young
man then, and with all the enthusiasm of youth he hunted
the big game of the Rockies, rode the "bucking broncho,"
and slept with his saddle for a pillow in the "round-up."</p>

<p>This life tested courage as well as endurance, but Roosevelt
was equal to the test. One day a drunken fellow
with pistols in his belt ordered him to treat the crowd.
Roosevelt knocked him down and took his guns from
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Law enforcement
under
difficulties</strong></div>

<p>Another time a boat was stolen, and Roosevelt, with
two other men, started down the river in pursuit. They
caught the three thieves, but an ice jam prevented them
from going farther. Through days of bitter cold the
whole party followed the slowly moving jam. After
while there was nothing left to eat but bread made with
the brown river water. But Roosevelt was a deputy
sheriff. He was determined to punish the lawbreakers.</p>

<p>Finally provisions and a wagon were found. Leaving
his men, Roosevelt started with his prisoners on a two-days'
overland trip. He had a driver, but he himself
tramped through the mud with his gun, behind the wagon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
At last after a one hundred and fifty mile trip, the lawbreakers
were landed in jail.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Wins
admiration
of
West</strong></div>

<p>In this big young country where bravery and manliness
meant so much, the people thought there was no one
like him.</p>


<p><strong>188. Returns to Politics.</strong> He was surprised just
before he left for the east to find that he was to be
nominated for mayor of New York, at the early age of
twenty-eight. He was defeated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Fights
spoilsmen
of all
parties</strong></div>

<p>He served as Civil Service Commissioner for four years
under President Harrison and for two years under Grover
Cleveland, a Democrat. He was not head of the commissioners,
but he worked so hard and fought the "spoilsman"
so boldly that everybody called it Roosevelt's
Commission. He had to fight Republicans and Democrats
alike, for they were bent on turning all men out of
office simply because the positions were needed for their
party workers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Roosevelt
and the
children
of the
tenement</strong></div>

<p>In 1895 Roosevelt was appointed police commissioner
for New York City. As head of the Police Board
he was on the Health Board, too. He took special
delight in looking after playgrounds for the children of
the slums. He was aided by Jacob Riis, who wrote
<em>How the Other Half Lives</em>. Roosevelt's idea was to take
children from the streets and put them in playgrounds
to prevent them from becoming "toughs." A Washington
city editor said, "Roosevelt is the biggest man in
New York City. I saw a steady stream of people go
up and down the stairs which led to police headquarters.
He has more visitors than the President." The truth
is, as police commissioner for all New York he was
commander-in-chief of an army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Merit
system
for
police</strong></div>

<p>A policeman before could not get promoted without a
"pull." But Roosevelt changed this. A Civil War
veteran who had served for a long time as a policeman
and had no "influence" rescued twenty-eight men and
women from drowning. Congress had given him two
medals, but New York City did nothing. Roosevelt
came. The veteran, one night, plunged into the icy river
and rescued a woman. Roosevelt showed his appreciation
by promoting him. Every man on the force did his best
now, for he knew promotion would come.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Builds up
United
States
Navy</strong></div>

<p>Roosevelt was called to be Assistant Secretary of the
Navy, under President McKinley. He built up the navy
and sent Dewey with the fleet to the Pacific. The war
with Spain came (1898). Roosevelt resigned from his
office, raised the Rough Riders, and took command with
Colonel Wood.</p>


<p><strong>189. Congress Orders Medal.</strong> For bravery in leading
the Rough Riders in a gallant charge up San Juan Hill
in the face of a murderous fire he was promoted, and a
medal was ordered for him.</p>

<p>He went back to New York with his Rough Riders.
They fairly worshiped him. "He knows everybody in
the regiment," said one. "He is as ready to listen to a
private as a major-general," said another. The boys
presented him with a statue of the "Broncho Buster."
Tears ran down the sun-tanned faces as a comrade made
a touching speech. Roosevelt now was a real hero.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Defies
bosses as
governor</strong></div>

<p>On his return from war he was elected governor of
New York. He told the leaders of his party that he
would be controlled by no man or set of men. He said
that he would gladly talk with all classes of men, but
must be permitted to make up his own mind. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
plain talk for the "bosses." "He just plays the honesty
game," said a Tammany politician.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>National
recognition
of his
work</strong></div>

<p>But he had the same old battles as in the days when he
was a young man in the assembly. He tried to run the
government of the state in a businesslike manner, and
his fight for cleaner politics was so determined that it
caught the interest of the entire country.</p>

<p>After two years he was nominated for the vice-presidency.
The New York "bosses" were glad because they
knew that as president of the Senate he could do very
little to disturb them. But he had set a good example,
and the great man who brought notice of his nomination
said, "There is not a young man in the United States
who has not found your life and influence an incentive
to better things and higher ideals."</p>

<p>He made a whirlwind campaign. He spoke for eight
weeks, in twenty-four states, traveling more than twenty
thousand miles, making nearly seven hundred speeches
to three million citizens.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>How he
had risen
to high
office</strong></div>


<p><strong>190. At Height of Ambition.</strong> The young man who
had made himself strong, who cherished the memory of
his father and mother, who had taught the mission class
while in college, who had joined the Republican Club
against the advice of his friends, who had fought against
spoilsmen in state and national politics, who battled for
the right of children to a breathing place in New York
City, who had led the Rough Riders up San Juan Hill,
who had stood as governor of New York against wrongdoing
in high as well as low places, who was made
Vice-President against his will, for the good of his party,
now stood at the height of political power in America.</p>

<p>The people loved him so well that they called him to
be President a second time; and that, too, by the largest
majority ever given to any President. He was the youngest
President ever elected.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Square
deal, his
motto</strong></div>

<p>His motto as President was "a square deal for everybody."
He did many wonderful things as President:
he stopped men from stealing public lands in the West;
he built great dams in the dry regions to hold the water
for raising crops; he established national parks containing
millions of acres of woodland; he kept millions of acres of
coal lands from falling into the hands of private companies;
he established fifty-one national reservations
where birds might nest and live protected from harm.
How he did enjoy saving what nature had given men!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A great
writer</strong></div>

<p>Down to his time, Roosevelt was the most learned man
ever President. He knew more subjects and knew them
better than most men. He was a great writer. For a long
time he thought that writing was to be his career. It turned
out to be only a small part of his crowded life, yet he wrote
over thirty books&mdash;more than any other President.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Roosevelt's
books</strong></div>

<p>He wrote histories, books on hunting, essays on American
life and ideals, and lives of famous men. His story
of his own life is well known. In his book, "The Strenuous
Life," he tries to rouse other people to as active and
fearless a life as he himself lived. He wrote always in
vigorous, stirring language. Nearly every one agrees that
Roosevelt's books alone would have made him famous.</p>


<p><strong>191. President Taft, an Advocate of Peace.</strong> Roosevelt
was President nearly two whole terms. He refused
another term, and worked for the nomination of his
Secretary of War, William Howard Taft.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/i_369a.jpg" width="325" height="540" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT</p></div>
</div>

<p>Taft was well fitted for his new tasks as President.
He had held many public
offices. He had made a very
wise and successful governor
of the Philippines.</p>

<p>President Taft was deeply
interested in the need of
world peace. He submitted
to the Senate wide-reaching
treaties to uphold peace with
France and Great Britain, and
also a reciprocity treaty with
Canada. Under this last
agreement the two countries
were to treat each other's
trade alike, and some things
were to be free of duty. The
outcome was disappointing.
Canada failed to accept the
reciprocity treaty, and the Senate passed the British and
French peace treaties only after changing them greatly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p>The passage of a new tariff bill caused a sharp division
among the Republicans. The tariff was much criticized;
but President Taft defended it. This was one reason
why, in the second half of his term, the lower house of
Congress became Democratic.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>New laws
passed</strong></div>

<p>A divided Congress could not easily agree on any
needed laws. Yet many good laws were passed during
Taft's presidency. One was a Parcel Post measure.
Two others proposed constitutional amendments for the
taxation of incomes, and the election of United States
senators directly by the people. Two new states, New
Mexico and Arizona, were admitted to the Union.</p>

<p>The growing differences between the two wings of the
Republicans in 1912 led to the nomination of both Taft
and Roosevelt. Both were defeated by Woodrow Wilson.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Taft

Yale</strong></div>

<p>After he left the presidency, Mr. Taft became professor
of law at Yale. But he now worked more earnestly than
ever in behalf of world peace. His sincere and generous
efforts in this cause won him increased influence and
respect throughout the nation.</p>


<p><strong>192. Roosevelt's Active Life as Ex-President.</strong> Roosevelt,
after his defeat in 1912, started out to explore a
Brazilian river. Four years before he had also made a
hunting trip through the tropical wildernesses of Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Explores
Brazilian
river</strong></div>

<p>Now Roosevelt and his party went into a jungle where
no white man had been before. They were faced with
tremendous hardships of all kinds.</p>

<p>The trip was longer than they expected, and there was
little food in the jungle. They ate palm cabbages, and
were glad to find a bit of wild honey or shoot a monkey.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A hazardous
voyage</strong></div>

<p>Most of the party became ill with fever. But they
scarcely dared halt. With their few provisions they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
in danger of starving. Roosevelt begged the party to
leave him behind, but no one would hear of it. So with
his party Roosevelt pushed on to civilization, at grave
risk to his life. The Brazilian government renamed the
six-hundred-mile river he explored Rio Roosevelt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>In the
World
War</strong></div>

<p>In the great World War, Roosevelt stood for the Allies
from the first. He opposed our neutrality and our failure
to get ready for the war which he saw coming.</p>

<p>When America declared war he begged to take an
army to Europe. Although for some reason he was not
sent, he did send four sons. Two of them, Theodore
and Archie, were wounded, and Quentin gave his life
flying and fighting inside the German lines.</p>

<p>In January, 1919, Theodore Roosevelt died. No other
man carried the love and admiration of the boys and girls
as did Roosevelt. The friendly name "Teddy" was the
children's name for this great man.</p>

suffered untold hardships from losing their way on the
sandy plains or among the mountains. Many hundreds
perished from sickness and hunger. In 1858, ten years
later, gold was discovered near Pike's Peak; in 1859,
silver was found in what is now southern Nevada. People
streamed westward in ever-increasing numbers. Long
lines of covered wagons, called "prairie schooners," filled
with fortune seekers toiled over the plains and mountain
trails. "Way stations" sprang up along the routes of
travel, to supply the needs of immigrants. These supply
stations soon grew into towns. Then came the discovery
of gold in what is now Idaho and Montana, and in the
Black Hills of the Dakotas. The westward tide of population
broadened. It filled the bounds of the United
States from the Dakotas to Texas; but it was the lure of
gold and silver that caused all this early development.</p>


<p><strong>194. A Faster Means of Travel.</strong> The demand for
means of rapid communication with the new West became
strong. It was necessary to bind the new country firmly
with the old. The "pony express" and the overland
stage were too risky and too slow.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>California
admitted
as
a state</strong></div>

<p>The number of people in California was increasing
steadily. In 1850, two years after the discovery of gold,
California with about one hundred thousand inhabitants
was admitted as a state. The Homestead Law of 1862,
by which settlers could easily obtain land, brought great
numbers of farmers to the western plains.</p>

<p>The first railway engine in the United States was built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
in 1830. Such engines had been in use in England for
some time. The earliest railroads were very short.
Seven companies
owned the parts of
the first line from
Albany, New York
to Buffalo. Now in
the same number of
great systems is included
two-thirds of
the mileage of the United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Rapid
growth
of railroads</strong></div>

<p>On March 10, 1869, the Union
Pacific Railway, the first link
between the Atlantic and the
Pacific, was finally completed.
There were then only a few
short lines besides, west of the
Mississippi. It was hard to find
the large amounts of capital needed for railway building.
Congress and the states helped the railroads by granting
them many square miles of land along their rights of way.
After 1869 the miles of railroad in the United States increased
over seven times in twenty years. To-day (1920)
seven great railways cross the mountains to the Pacific
coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Farming
develops</strong></div>


<p><strong>195. The Growth of Farming.</strong> The railroads brought
thousands of settlers into the new regions. But it was
no longer to hunt for gold. It was to build homes on the
rich farm lands of the West.</p>

<p>Miners, cattlemen, farmers, and permanent settlers
crowded on the lands of the Indians. The regions occupied
by the red men now became smaller and smaller.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
Nearly all the Indians were placed on reservations on land
which the national government does not allow to pass
out of their hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Irrigation
projects
aided by
the
government</strong></div>

<p>The need of more and still more land brought the
farmers to the dry slopes and plateaus of both sides of the
Rockies. Here were vast regions which water would
make productive. The government gave its support to
great irrigation projects. Water was brought to the barren
deserts and they became vast expanses of waving grain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Gold becomes
more
difficult
to get</strong></div>

<p>In California the rich gold deposits which lay comparatively
free were growing smaller. The gold seekers were
no longer able to wash gold from the sands and gravel of
the river beds, or to find nuggets in rocky hollows of the
hillsides. They had to make a living in some other way.
Vast mineral resources were still there, but they could
only be reached by mining. Expensive machinery was
necessary, and companies were formed to work the
deposits.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>California
a
great
agricultural
state</strong></div>

<p>Then began the real development of California and the
great Pacific Northwest. Up to 1875 California had been
peopled with prospectors for gold. Now the output of
minerals kept increasing, but the farm crops grew still
faster in value until in 1920 they were worth many times
the mineral output, because of the wonderful climate and
the richness of the land.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The leading
fruit-growing
state</strong></div>

<p>The first product to which the settler turned was wheat.
California became one of the leading wheat states of the
Union. Then the state discovered its great fruit-growing
possibilities, and to-day it raises the largest fruit crop
in the nation. People at first became almost as excited
about their golden orange crops as they had been over
yellow metal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Great

<p>Meanwhile great cities were springing up rapidly, and
the riches of forest, mine, and stream brought unlimited
prosperity and growth. Los Angeles, San Francisco,

great cities of the Union.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Agriculture

<p>From the Mississippi valley to the mountains agriculture
and commerce developed with great strides. Enormous

immense numbers of cattle and sheep could be slaughtered
and the meat shipped to all parts of the world.</p>

<h3>GEORGE WASHINGTON GOETHALS, CHIEF ENGINEER OF
THE PANAMA CANAL</h3>

<p><strong>196. The Panama Canal.</strong> In the great rush of gold
seekers to the Pacific coast, many of the thousands who
started out never reached
California, for the crossing of
the Panama isthmus and the
long journey around Cape
Horn were both full of danger.</p>

<p>It was this which first made
Americans realize the value to
their country of a canal across
the Isthmus. As time passed,
the great development of the
Pacific coast region brought
demands for fast and easy
communication with the East.
Railroads were built across the
mountains, but transportation was still very expensive.
The remedy lay in a short route by water between the east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
and the west coasts. Then came the Spanish-American
War and the wonderful trip of the <em>Oregon</em>. People now
saw that a canal across the Isthmus of Panama must
be built at whatever cost.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Work

<p>In 1869 a French company had begun building a canal
at Panama. They met great difficulties. The expense
was so heavy and the waste of money so great that little
progress was made before the company failed. In 1903
the United States bought the rights of the French company
and obtained a strip of land ten miles wide from the
new Republic of Panama. Work was then begun by our
government where the French had left off.</p>

<p><strong>197. George Washington Goethals.</strong> During the progress
of the work there were several changes in the position
of chief engineer in charge of building the canal. In 1907
this work was given to George Washington Goethals, of
the corps of army engineers. Colonel Goethals was
born in Brooklyn, June 29, 1858. He was clearly a boy
of unusual ability. At the age of fifteen he entered the
College of the City of New York. At graduation he
stood at the head of his class. He then took up the study
of engineering at the United States Military Academy at
West Point. He advanced rapidly, and when twenty-four
years of age was appointed first lieutenant of army
engineers. After teaching at West Point for several
years he was appointed captain of engineers. His ability
caused him to be given charge of the Mussel Shoals Canal
Construction on the Tennessee River. During the Spanish-American
War he served with the volunteers as lieutenant-colonel
and chief of engineers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Goethals
put in
charge</strong></div>

<p>In 1907 came the great opportunity of his life. He was
given charge of building the Panama Canal. He faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
a gigantic task. But the government of his country had
entrusted it to him, and he determined to do it without
losing more lives by fever than necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Canal

<p>The great work was finished at a comparatively low
cost. Meanwhile Colonel Goethals had cleaned up the
Canal Zone and made it a healthful place to live in.</p>

<p>The building of the Canal took about eight years'
time, required the services of forty thousand men, and
cost the United States four hundred million dollars.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Goethals

<p>When the Canal was nearly finished, in 1914, a civil
government was established in the Canal Zone. President
Wilson appointed Colonel Goethals the first governor.
The enormous task which he had done so well showed
that he was a great manager as well as a great engineer.</p>

<p><strong>198. Value of the Canal to the Pacific Coast.</strong> The
Pacific Coast States now more than ever ranked high among
the leading states of the country. They could now send
the valuable products of their forests, streams, fields,
and mines to the Atlantic coast by water. The water
route to New York has been shortened by 7,800 miles,
and to Europe by more than 5,600 miles. The canal
supplies a cheaper means of carrying freight than the
overland route, and there is no limit to its usefulness for
this purpose.</p>

<h3>THOMAS A. EDISON, THE GREATEST INVENTOR OF
ELECTRICAL MACHINERY IN THE WORLD</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>His
parentage</strong></div>


<p><strong>199. The Wizard of the Electrical World.</strong> Thomas A.
Edison was born in 1847 at Milan, Ohio. His father's
people were Dutch and his mother's were Scotch. When
he was seven years of age his parents removed to Port
Huron, Michigan.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>EDISON SELLING PAPERS AFTER THE BATTLE
OF PITTSBURG LANDING</p></div>
</div>

<p>Edison owed his early training to his mother's care. At
the age of twelve he was reading such books as Gibbon's
<cite>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</cite>, Hume's <cite>History
of England</cite>, Newton's
<cite>Principia</cite>, and
Ure's <cite>Dictionary of
Science</cite>. The last-named
book was
too full of mathematics
for him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A tireless
reader</strong></div>

<p>That Edison was
a great reader is
proved by his resolution
to read all
the books in the
Detroit Free Library!
He did finish
"fifteen feet of
volumes" before any one knew what he was doing.</p>

<p>In 1862 General Grant fought the terrible battle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
Pittsburg Landing. Everybody wanted to hear the news.
Edison bought a thousand newspapers, boarded a train,
and the engineer allowed him a few minutes at each
station to sell papers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>His experience
as
a newsboy</strong></div>

<p>As the first station came in sight, Edison looked ahead
and saw a wild crowd of men. He grabbed an armful
of papers, rushed out, and sold forty before the train left.
At the next station the platform was crowded with a
yelling mob. He raised the price to ten cents, but sold
one hundred fifty.</p>

<p>Finally he reached Port Huron. The station was a
mile from town. Edison seized his papers. He met the
crowd coming just as he reached a church where a prayer
meeting was being held. The prayer meeting broke up,
and though he raised his price to twenty-five cents he
"took in a young fortune."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Experimenting
in electricity</strong></div>

<p>Edison began very early to make experiments in electricity.
After rigging up a line at home, hitching the
wire to the legs of a cat, and rubbing the cat's back
vigorously, he saw the failure of his first experiment&mdash;the
cat would not stand!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Saves a
life and

<p>At Mt. Clemens, one day, young Edison saw a child
playing on the railroad with its back to an on-coming
freight train. He dashed at the child, and both tumbled
to the ground at the roadside. For this act of bravery
the telegraph operator gave him lessons in telegraphy.</p>

days, then disappeared. He returned with a complete
set of telegraphic instruments made by his own hand!
After his trade was learned he began a period of wandering
as a telegraph operator. For many boys still in their
teens this would have been a time of destruction, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
Edison neither drank nor smoked. He wandered from
Adrian to Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Memphis,
and Boston, stopping
for shorter or longer periods
at each place.</p>

<p>By the time he was
twenty-two he had invented
and partly finished his plan
of sending two dispatches
along the same wire at the
same time. This was equal
to doubling the number of
wires in use.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Repairs

<p>Edison was a poor boy

went from Boston to New
York. The speculators in
Wall Street were wild with excitement, for the electric
machinery had broken down. Nobody could make it
work. Edison pushed his way to the front, saw the
difficulty, and at once removed it.</p>

<p>All were loud in their praise of Edison. On the next
day he was engaged to take charge of all the electric
machinery at three hundred dollars per month.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Receives

<p>After a time he joined a company and gave his time

for his inventions. He had already decided to say five
thousand dollars. But when the men came he said that
he did not know. He was dumfounded when they offered
him forty thousand dollars!</p>

<p><strong>201. Edison's Inventions.</strong> In 1873 Edison established
his first laboratory or workshop in Newark, New Jersey.
Here he gathered more than three hundred men to turn
out the inventions pertaining to electricity which his
busy brain suggested. They were all as enthusiastic
over the inventions as Edison himself. No fixed hours
of labor in this shop! When the day's work was done
the men often begged to be allowed to return to the

<p>Many telegraph and telephone inventions were made
in this laboratory. There were forty-five inventions
all told. They brought in so much money that Edison
decided they must have a better place to work. He
built at Menlo Park, New Jersey, twenty-four miles
from New York City, the finest laboratory then in the
world. On instruments alone he spent $100,000. In
the great laboratory at Menlo Park Edison gathered one
of the finest scientific libraries that money could buy.
This library was for the men in the factory&mdash;to help
them in their inventions and to give them pleasure.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Edison's

<p>Sounds reach the ear by means of air waves which the
sounding body sets in motion. In Edison's first phonograph
these waves struck a bit of taut parchment, and
were marked by a needle on a tinfoil disc. But tinfoil
does not hold its shape well. In 1888 Edison patented a
better phonograph in which the record was made on a
wax disc.</p>

<p>Phonograph records are now made with one hundred
grooves to an inch. Each groove is not more than four
one-thousandths of an inch deep. A lever tipped with
sapphire cuts the grooves. Its tiny marks have been
photographed&mdash;one way of seeing a sound!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What the

<p>The phonograph is used everywhere for amusement.
It preserves the voices of great singers for the future.
With it songs and bits of folklore can be collected in languages
that are now dying out.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
electric
light</strong></div>

<p>Edison has put into practical use many principles discovered
by other men. He does not claim to be the discoverer
of the electric light. He did much, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
to make it useful to people in lighting their houses, and
also in lighting great cities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The first
great
electrical
exhibition</strong></div>

<p>In the winter of 1880, in Menlo Park, Edison gave to
the public an exhibition of his electric light. Visitors
came from all parts of the country to see this wonderful
show. Seven hundred lights were put up in the streets,
and inside the buildings. Edison had produced a much
better light than any that had been used before.</p>


<p><strong>202. A Great New Industry.</strong> Edison also had a part
in another invention for which Americans can claim most
of the credit&mdash;moving pictures.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Settling
a racetrack
dispute</strong></div>

<p>A dispute about horseracing did most for the discovery
of moving pictures. The question was whether a horse
ever had all four feet off the ground at once. To settle
it, Edward Muybridge, an employee of the government,
was called in. He stretched cords, fastened to the shutters
of a row of cameras, across a racetrack. As the horse
ran past, it took its own pictures. Later Muybridge
made a camera which would take pictures very quickly,
but he could not show his pictures well.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Edison's
camera</strong></div>

<p>Edison in 1892 invented a camera which used long strips
of celluloid film. These pictures were looked at through
a slot by one person at a time.</p>

<p>Another government worker, C. Francis Jenkins, invented
the first complete moving picture machine in 1894.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

<p>At first people were slow to welcome the new kind of

moving pictures. Probably as many tickets are sold
here each year as there are people in the world.</p>

<p>In the war each army had its own moving picture

airplane battles, and of the fighting among the icy peaks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
the Alps, often at great danger to their own lives. Great
events of world history like the signing of the armistice
can now be recorded for future times. Such pictures
teach us things that cannot easily be learned from books.</p>

<p>Many schools have a machine of their own, and use
moving pictures as a part of their regular class work.
The subject is first outlined, then the pictures are shown,
and afterwards the pupils write about what they have
learned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Moving
pictures
in
schools</strong></div>

<p>Some schools have films of their own. Others find it
easy to get them. Our government sends out educational
films on silo building, dairying, airplane manufacture, and
many government activities. Business firms have films
to loan on shoes, soap, automobiles, and other things they
make. Regular film companies have pictures of animal
life, the natural wonders of our country, current events,
foreign countries, and other subjects suitable for school
use, such as the teaching of cube root by moving picture
cartoons.</p>

<p>Outside of schools moving pictures can be used for
educational purposes in social service and Americanization
work. One state, North Carolina, has trucks carrying
moving picture machines for many of its counties. Programs
of educational and amusing pictures can be given
regularly in small towns with these machines.</p>

<h3>TWO INVENTIONS WIDELY USED IN BUSINESS</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
work of
many
inventors</strong></div>


<p><strong>203. Christopher L. Sholes and the Typewriter.</strong> The
typewriter cannot be called the invention of any one man.
Many inventors, half of them Americans, worked on the
problem, for even a simple machine has many parts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 540px;">
<img src="images/i_387a.jpg" width="540" height="392" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>TYPEWRITER AND DICTAPHONE</p></div>
</div>

<p>Machines by which the blind could print or type raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
letters were first made. A little difficulty may hold back
a great invention. A typewriter was not built until long
afterward because
inventors did not
know how to ink type.</p>

<p>In the Scientific
American more than
fifty years ago was
printed an article on a
new invention which
was rather grandly
called the "literary
piano." Christopher
Latham Sholes, a Wisconsin editor read the article.
He was convinced that he could make a better typewriter
than this himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
earliest
typewriter</strong></div>

<p>He set to work, and his first typewriter was patented
in 1868. It was indeed something like a piano. It had
long ivory and ebony keys, but it also had a third set of
peg-shaped keys like those we now use. It carried its
type on levers arranged in a circle. It had a spacer, and
a way to move the paper along as it was typed, as well as
inked ribbon, which he borrowed from an earlier inventor.</p>

<p>Sholes' was the first successful practical typewriter
made. Now nearly twenty million dollars' worth are
produced in this country each year.</p>


<p><strong>204. The Dictaphone in Business Offices.</strong> An interesting
outgrowth of Edison's phonograph is the dictaphone,
used in dictating business letters. It consists of
two machines much alike. On the first are put smooth
cylinders of wax. The person dictating speaks through
a tube. Then the dictaphone operator puts the cylinders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
on her machine, places light tubes in her ears, and takes
down the dictation on her typewriter as she hears it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 540px;">

<div class="caption"><p>THE DICTAPHONE IN USE</p></div>
</div>

<p>Both machines are
run by electric motors,
and that of the operator
can be stopped
with the foot. The
wax cylinders may be
pared and used again
and again.</p>

<p>The dictaphone
means a great saving
of time and labor, for
dictating can be done anywhere at any moment.</p>

<h3>AUTOMOBILE MAKING IN THE UNITED STATES</h3>


<p><strong>205. The Earliest Automobiles.</strong> The first kind of
automobile men tried to build was a "steam carriage."
A Frenchman in 1755 invented a steam road wagon
meant to draw a field gun. But his invention could
not be steered, and was soon wrecked by running
into a wall.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>"Steamers"</strong></div>

<p>In England one hundred years ago a few of these
"steamers" were run as stage coaches. They were
noisy, clumsy "steamers" and always likely to explode.
They were not popular, and a law was passed that a man
must always walk ahead of them carrying a red flag.
They were only allowed to go only four miles an hour.
Of course this meant they could not be used at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Watts
could
not
imagine
good
roads</strong></div>

<p>Oliver Evans of Philadelphia built the first steam automobile
in the United States in 1804, to carry a steam
flatboat he had made down to the river. Evans and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
other inventors after him for nearly one hundred years
worked on self-driven carriages, but could interest no one
in their plans. Watts, the great English inventor of the
steam engine, stopped a friend who had all but invented
an automobile. It was useless, he said; roads would not
allow such rapid travel. Watts could discover steam
power, but it never occurred to him that good roads
could be easily built. The use of rubber tires in 1887
stopped the jolting that had been such a difficulty.</p>

<p>In 1892 Charles Duryea built the first gasoline automobile
in America. He tried to get money to continue
his work. He told a business man, "You and I will live
to see more automobiles than horses on the street." The
man thought him crazy, and refused to help him. Now
horses are becoming rare in large cities.</p>

<p><strong>206. America, the Land of Automobiles.</strong> In 1891 the
first electric vehicle in this country was made. The first
gasoline car was sold March 24, 1898. Now, twenty
years later, this country is manufacturing nearly half a
million cars annually.
Other countries are
backward by comparison.
Four-fifths of all
the automobiles in the
world are owned in the
United States.</p>

<p>Motor trucks can

<p>One time when the German army threatened Paris it
was only the unbroken stream of motor trucks moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>

the front that saved the city. In memory of its service

<h3>WILBUR AND ORVILLE WRIGHT, THE MEN WHO
GAVE HUMANITY WINGS</h3>


<p><strong>207. Early Attempts to Fly.</strong> To sail through the air
as birds do is an ambition that has dazzled men since
ancient times. The Greek myths tell us of Phaeton who
drove the horses of the sun, and of Icarus who flew too
near the sun with his wings of feathers and wax.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;">
<img src="images/i_390a.jpg" width="470" height="540" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>WILBUR WRIGHT</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Studying
birds</strong></div>

<p>To learn how to fly men studied the wings of huge
birds living millions of years ago, made careful mathematical
reckonings about them, and then made themselves
wings of feathers or skin. But with these wings
they could only glide to earth from high towers or cliffs.
One useful thing they learned from this study. They
found that the wing of a bird
is bent as you bend a long
piece of paper if you hold it
by opposite corners and start
to twist it. This is called the
principle of the screw, and
is now used in making the
propeller blades of airplanes.</p>


<p><strong>208. The First Airplanes.</strong>
Early airplanes, airplane
models and "gliders" were
made in the queerest, most
outlandish shapes imaginable.
They had from one to five or more planes, arranged
at almost every possible angle. Some looked like a row<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
of box kites, some like dragons, and some like a collection
of old fashioned windmill wheels all fastened together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_391a.jpg" width="480" height="540" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>ORVILLE WRIGHT</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was only a little while ago
that men were working with
these strange models, for it was
only about ten years before the
World War that a successful
airplane flight was first made.</p>

<p>The invention of the balloon
came late in the history of
flying. Two sons of a French
paper manufacturer probably
made the first balloon. They
filled a large bag with hot air
from a bonfire, and found that it rose and sailed away.</p>

<p>Early balloons were carried through the air by wind
currents, and could not be guided. Their passengers
were often blown out to sea and drowned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Zeppelins</strong></div>

<p>A German, Count Zeppelin, invented a balloon called a
dirigible, because it could be directed through the air.
The Germans named these large cigar-shaped balloons
"zeppelins," after their inventor.</p>

<p>Dirigibles are now built more than two blocks long,
about the length of the largest battleships. They can
lift heavy loads, but are very expensive and very easily
broken, and require huge sheds or houses to shelter them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>First
successful
flight</strong></div>

<p>An airship properly means a dirigible, while an airplane
is a heavier-than-air machine. The first successful flight
of any length in an airplane that could be directed was
made by Wilbur Wright in 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North
Carolina. It was also the first time an airplane had been
driven by a gasoline engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Did

<p><strong>209. The Wright Brothers.</strong> Wilbur Wright was one
of two brothers who had long been working on the
problem of a flying machine. He was born in 1867, and
his brother Orville in 1871. Their father was a bishop
whose excellent library took the place of a university
education for his boys. Wilbur and Orville studied
especially works on physics, mathematics, and engineering.
They earned their living by making and repairing
bicycles. But they spent much time experimenting with
different kinds of gliders. They also studied the action
of the atmosphere. Aërostatics, or the science of the air,
is a very difficult and important part of flying.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Flights
by airplane
models</strong></div>

<p>Before Wilbur Wright's success in 1903 progress of
various kinds had been made. Fairly long flights with
gliders had been made in different countries. Two
Americans, Langley and Hiram Maxim, had worked out
models driven by steam. Langley's had flown half a
mile over the Potomac, and Maxim's, though not allowed
to fly freely, was strong enough to carry a man.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A DIRIGIBLE BALLOON</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Wright
brothers were
wise in employing
a gasoline
motor.
A steam engine,
with its
large boilers,
was of course
much heavier.
They had a
rudder in the tail of their machine, but they also invented a
new method of steering. By "warping" or bending the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
planes, a monoplane, with its one set of wings could keep
its balance as well as a biplane, which has two.</p>

<img src="images/i_393a.jpg" width="540" height="386" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>AN EARLY WRIGHT AIRPLANE</p></div>
</div>

<p>After Wilbur
Wright's first flight
in 1903 several
Frenchmen made
successful flights.
But in 1908 Wilbur
Wright went to
France and broke
the records of all
the French flyers
by the unparalleled
feat of remaining in the air for more than two hours.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Air
records</strong></div>

<p>Now the airplane can do all kinds of fantastic tricks.
Aviators "loop the loop" dozens of times, and move in
any direction through the air at will. They can rise in
the air thirty-six thousand feet, and can fly at the rate of
three miles a minute. In 1907 Orville Wright made the
first record flight
of an hour. All
this has been accomplished
in
scarcely more than
a dozen years since
then. Flying developed
especially
rapidly during the
World War. Airplanes
were used
to spy out the enemy's defenses, to direct gunfire, to drop
bombs, to shoot down soldiers, and to hunt submarines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
The daring and brilliant fighting of airmen in the World
War makes a story more breathless than that of any
novel. Incidents
like landing with
burning planes
or with planes
partly stripped of
their canvas were
not uncommon for
these fighters of
the air.</p>

<p>One type of
airplane was used
for fighting and another heavier type for bombing. Air
bombing is now so accurate that in the future it may be
useless to build super-dreadnaughts and large battleships.</p>


<p><strong>210. Peace Time Uses of the Airplane.</strong> During times
of peace airplanes are useful in exploring and for carrying
passengers and light freight. Airplanes scarcely more
expensive than the earlier automobiles can now be bought.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Airplanes

<p>Airplanes in this country are chiefly used for carrying
mail. "The mail must fly" is the slogan of the mailmen
of the air, and in storm or fog&mdash;even in the face of a
tornado&mdash;it has gone.</p>

<p>In May, 1919, a hydroplane belonging to the United
States navy made the first trip across the ocean. A
hydroplane is an airplane having a boat-like body so that
it is able to alight on or rise from the water.</p>

<h3>JOHN P. HOLLAND, WHO TAUGHT MEN HOW TO SAIL
UNDER THE SEA</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Bushnell
and
Fulton
and the
undersea
boat</strong></div>


<p><strong>211. The Submarine.</strong> During the War of the Revolution
an American named Bushnell worked on the
problem of making a boat that would sail under the
surface of the sea. He was the first to work on this
problem and is called the Father of the Submarine.
Some years later Robert Fulton (page <a href="#Page_257">257</a>) became
interested in the submarine. In 1801 he built one for
the French government. But Fulton turned his efforts
to making steamboats and did not continue his plans
for a successful diving boat.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>John P.
Holland,
1842</strong></div>


<p><strong>212. John P. Holland.</strong> John P. Holland was born
in Ireland in 1842. He was a studious boy and became
a teacher. The stories of Bushnell and of Fulton interested
him and he studied carefully what they had done.</p>

<p>He came to America and settled in New Jersey. There
he got a position as teacher in a parochial school. He
continued his study of the undersea boat making many
experiments and tests.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 504px;">

<div class="caption"><p>JOHN P. HOLLAND</p>

<p><em>From a photograph</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Holland's first submarine
became stuck in the mud.
But he did not give up.
His next boat he called the
"Fenian Ram." It frightened
people when it suddenly
raised its head out
of the water and as quickly
disappeared.</p>

<p>In 1895, after a number
of severe tests, Holland succeeded
in interesting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
United States Government in his plans. He built for it
a submarine which he named the "Plunger."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 540px;">
<img src="images/i_396a.jpg" width="540" height="319" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A SUBMARINE</p></div>
</div>

<p>Holland now
formed a company
to build
his boats. In
1898 he produced
the famous
Holland
submarine.
This boat
settled any
doubt about
what submarines could do. It was only fifty feet long,
but it could dive under water and rise again at the will of
the inventor. From that time the Holland company built
many submarines for all the great nations of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
periscope</strong></div>

<p>From the top of the submarine there extends upward
a long slender tube called a periscope. When the boat
is under water the end of this tube extends above the
surface. By means of a certain arrangement of lenses
and mirrors in this tube, the observer in the submarine
can see everything on the surface of the water. In this
way the boat can be guided in any direction.</p>

<p>Holland died in 1914.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Value
in war</strong></div>


<p><strong>213. The Submarine in War and Peace.</strong> The submarine
is much used in war time. The war diver is
provided with one and sometimes two tubes through
which torpedoes or bombs may be fired at enemy ships
while the submarine is hidden under water. It is very
hard to detect a submarine when it is under the water.
The only sign of its approach is a slight ripple on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
surface. But if we look straight down at the water
from high up in the air, then the outlines of the boat
can easily be seen. In war time airplanes are used
in spying out the submarine.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Use of
the submarine
in peace</strong></div>

<p>In times of peace, too, the submarine is of great value.
It is not exposed to great storms on the sea, since it can
escape the waves by submerging. These boats can
cross the ocean and are large enough to carry cargoes of
valuable goods. In July, 1916, the world was startled by
the arrival of the merchant submarine, "Deutschland,"
at Baltimore. Loaded with articles of trade, mainly
chemicals, she left Bremen, dodged the British and
French blockade, and in fifteen days reached America.</p>

<p>One cause of America's entering the World War was
Germany's attempt to starve England by a submarine
blockade.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Fighting
the submarine</strong></div>


<p><strong>214. Other Inventions in the War.</strong> The "depth bomb"
was an out and out new invention. 11 could be "dropped"
over the spot where a submarine was seen. Very often
it blew the submarine to pieces.</p>

<p>The "tank" was a "moving iron fort" drawn by a
tractor. It could tear wire entanglements to pieces and
cross enemy trenches. The "depth bomb" and "tank"
were used mainly by the Allies.</p>

<p>The wide use of "poison gas" was first introduced by
the Germans. Guns able to shoot many miles were
invented. One of them carried seventy miles or more.</p>

<h3>ELIZABETH CADY STANTON AND SUSAN B. ANTHONY,
TWO PIONEERS IN THE CAUSE OF
WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Women
play an
important
part
in early
progress</strong></div>


<p><strong>215. The Women of Our Nation.</strong> Women have had
a large part in the progress of our nation. In colonial
days women often had to defend their homes against
Indians. They endured the hardships of the first settlements
as bravely as did the men. They had larger rights
and greater freedom than in England at that time, because
their help was so plainly necessary in this new country.</p>

<p>By 1850 nearly one-fourth of the nation's manufacturing
was done by women, but otherwise until that time
women's lives were spent almost entirely in their homes.
Though no colleges were open to women until 1833, many
mothers knew enough of books to prepare their sons for
college at home.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Women's
service
in war</strong></div>

<p>During the Revolution women formed a society called
"Daughters of Liberty," to spin and sew for their soldiers.
They gave their treasured pewter spoons and dishes to be
melted up for bullets. As women have always done, they
cared for the sick and wounded after battles.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>ELIZABETH CADY STANTON</p>

<p><em>From a photograph</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>In the great Civil War, women were needed still more to
nurse the wounded, for even then there was no Red Cross
or large body of women who were nurses by profession to
call upon. Women took the place of the men called to
war in many ways, and especially in teaching schools.
On both sides women worked in the fields, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
acted as spies, or served, disguised, in the ranks. Southern
women also entered the factories in large numbers. They
had to meet even greater
hardship than women in
the North, and were often
face to face with starvation.</p>

<p>On the frontier women
had always worked in the
fields when necessary,
and often helped to build
the houses they lived in.
The fearless pioneering
spirit and fine, sturdy
character of these women
won them the highest
respect. This was one
reason why western states were the first to grant women
the right to vote.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Women's
equality
with
men</strong></div>

<p>Long before the Civil War great leaders in the cause of
woman's advancement had appeared. These leaders saw
that in many ways women had proved their equality
with men. This encouraged them to appeal for wider
opportunities for women, who then had almost no legal
rights. The leaders now demanded the privileges enjoyed
only by men. We should all know the stories of these
women of wise and fearless vision.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Born,
1815</strong></div>


<p><strong>216. Elizabeth Cady Stanton.</strong> Elizabeth Cady was
born in New York, in 1815. Her girlhood was a happy
one, spent with her brother and sisters. She was a
healthy, rosy-cheeked girl, full of life and fun, who believed
girls were the equals of boys and had just as much intellect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Studies
hard</strong></div>

<p>When Elizabeth was eleven years old her brother died.
Her father grieved deeply over the loss of his only son,
and Elizabeth determined to try to be to her father all
that her brother might have been. She therefore applied
herself diligently to study and self-improvement.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Finds
woman's
position
unequal</strong></div>

<p>Her father was a lawyer. He had been a member of
Congress. Many hours out of school Elizabeth spent in
his office, listening while his clients stated their cases. She
gradually became indignant at what she found to be the
unequal position of women in almost every walk of life.
She determined to devote her life to securing for women
the same rights and privileges that men had.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Marries
Henry B.
Stanton</strong></div>

<p>While studying she did not neglect the arts of housekeeping.
She regarded these as occupations of the highest
dignity and importance. When twenty-five years old
she married Henry B. Stanton, a lawyer and journalist
who since his student days had talked and written against
slavery. But she did not forget her old resolve to struggle
for the rights of women, even when occupied with the
duties of home and children.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Calls
woman's
rights
convention</strong></div>


<p><strong>217. The First Woman's Rights Convention.</strong> In
1848 Mrs. Stanton called a woman's rights convention&mdash;the
first ever held. Its purpose was "to discuss the social,
civil, and religious conditions and rights of women."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>"Declaration
of
Sentiments"</strong></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Women
demand
the right
to vote</strong></div>

<p>Mrs. Stanton read to the convention a set of twelve
resolutions, the now famous "Declaration of Sentiments."
It demanded for women equality with men and "all the
rights and privileges which belong to them as citizens of
the United States," including the right to vote. This was
the first public demand for woman's suffrage. The resolutions
were passed. A storm of ridicule followed the convention,
but Mrs. Stanton's position remained unchanged.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Susan B.
Anthony,
1820</strong></div>


<p><strong>218. Susan B. Anthony.</strong> A few years after this historic
convention, Mrs. Stanton met Susan B. Anthony.
Miss Anthony was the
daughter of Friends, or
Quakers as they are often
called. She was born at
South Adams, Massachusetts,
in 1820. Her father
maintained a school at Battenville,
New York, and
here Susan received her
early education.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Teaches
school</strong></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Won to
the cause
of
woman's
rights</strong></div>

<p>From her seventeenth
birthday until she met Mrs.
Stanton, Miss Anthony had
been engaged in teaching school. But now the great
national questions of anti-slavery and temperance were
drawing her away from her work as a teacher. At first
Miss Anthony had not been in sympathy with the
Declaration of Sentiments, but when she met Mrs.
Stanton the cause of woman's rights won an able, enthusiastic,
and untiring friend.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>National
Woman's
Suffrage
Association</strong></div>

<p>From this time on these two fought side by side for
the cause of women. They traveled and lectured in all
parts of the country. In 1868 they started a weekly
paper, which they called <em>The Revolution</em>. Miss Anthony
was the business manager and Mrs. Stanton was the
editor. Its motto was, "The True Republic&mdash;men,
their rights and nothing more; women, their rights and
nothing less."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Miss
Anthony

President</strong></div>

<p>In 1869 they organized the National Woman's Suffrage
Association. In many states the question of woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
suffrage became an important one at election. Wherever
they were needed, in California, in New York, or in any
other state, these two women could be found. Every
year from 1869 until her death, in 1906, Miss Anthony
addressed committees of Congress. In 1872 she cast a
vote for President. She declared it to be her right under
the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. For
this act she was arrested and fined, but the fine was
never collected.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Women
win suffrage</strong></div>

<p>Mrs. Stanton died in 1902. The great movement she
had started was on its way to certain victory. Congress
passed the suffrage amendment in 1919, and in August,
1920, it became law. Over twenty-five million women
were entitled to vote in the presidential elections that year.</p>

<h3>JULIA WARD HOWE, AUTHOR OF THE "BATTLE HYMN OF
THE REPUBLIC," AND HARRIET BEECHER STOWE
WHO WROTE "UNCLE TOM'S CABIN"</h3>


<p><strong>219. Julia Ward Howe.</strong> All the great wars in which
our country has engaged have brought heavy burdens
and sorrow to women. They could not march away to
fight side by side with the men. Their duty was to cheer
their loved ones as they went away to danger and perhaps
to death.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Women
in the
Civil
War</strong></div>

<p>At the outbreak of the Civil War, from thousands and
thousands of homes father, husband, son, or brother went
away, in many instances never to return. Women were
left behind, praying for their loved ones and working
untiringly night and day to provide food and clothing
and to keep up their homes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Born
1819</strong></div>

<p>But there were other women who could not serve their
country in this way. Many had no one to send away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
to fight. Among these was Julia Ward Howe. She was
born in New York in 1819, of wealthy and distinguished
parents. She was carefully reared, but she knew little of
the work that girls are usually taught to do. Practically
everything was done for her by servants. However,
Julia dearly loved to read and study, and very early she
began to write poetry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Marries
Doctor
Howe</strong></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Desires
to be of
service
to the
Union</strong></div>

<p>In 1841 she married Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, a noted
teacher and reformer. While visiting in Washington in
1861 she saw women nursing the wounded soldiers brought
in from the battle field of Bull Run. She was deeply
stirred by the sights around her. What service could
she do for her country? Her husband was too old to
enter the army, her son too young. She knew that
there were thousands making clothes for the soldiers
in the field. But she could not sew for the soldiers or
care for the wounded, for she had never been taught to
work with her hands. She could only write poetry. Of
what use was that now?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Writes
"Battle
Hymn
of the
Republic"</strong></div>

<p>One day her minister suggested that she write words
for the popular army tune, "John Brown's Body Lies
A-mouldering in the Grave." She did so, and the poem
was published in a magazine under the name of "The
Battle Hymn of the Republic."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>It helps
to bring
victory</strong></div>

<p>Soon the song was being sung through all the camps of
the northern troops. The soldiers sang it on the march,
in wild charges, or at night beside the camp fire. Everywhere
its challenge roused the northern soldiers to a more
determined fight for victory. In writing this poem Mrs.
Howe had done a great service for the Union.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Founds
clubs for
women</strong></div>


<p><strong>220. The Woman's Club.</strong> After the war Mrs. Howe
wished to continue serving her country in some way, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
she took up the cause of woman's rights. Women had
had little or no chance to educate themselves and broaden
their minds by discussing
with each other subjects
outside their
homes. She thought
woman's clubs would
work to free women
from the narrowness of
mind that comes from
thinking only of dress,
hired help, and housekeeping.
From then
on, she devoted herself
to establishing clubs for
women. She traveled
over the country and
wrote and lectured on this subject. She urged that the
members of these clubs should seek not only for self-improvement
but for means of serving others; and through
their efforts hospitals for women and children, lodging
houses, and labor schools were established.</p>

<p>Mrs. Howe had found a means of serving her country
even greater and more effective than the writing of her
"Battle Hymn of the Republic."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Born,
1811</strong></div>


<p><strong>221. Harriet Beecher Stowe.</strong> Another woman who
did great service for her country with her pen was Harriet
Beecher Stowe. She was born in 1811. Her father was
a Connecticut minister, and she was brought up in a deeply
religious home. At school she was apt at writing and
she dreamed of becoming a great author.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Marries
Calvin
E. Stowe</strong></div>

<p>She married Calvin E. Stowe, a student of theology,
and thereafter devoted herself to her home and her
children. During the years just before the Civil War
there was much discussion of the slavery question.
Mrs. Stowe had traveled in the South and had seen how
the negroes were kept in ignorance, and how cruelly they
were sometimes treated. She was aroused by the passage
of the Fugitive Slave Law and by some of the things that
happened as a result of it. She resolved to use her talent
for writing to help the slaves.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Writes
"Uncle
Tom's
Cabin"</strong></div>

<p>In 1851 she began the story, <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>. It
was first published in serial form in an abolition paper
in Washington. It was later published in book form.
From the first, the sale of the book was enormous. It
was translated into many languages and was very popular
abroad as well as at home.</p>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Stowe became famous.
It is said that the book converted
more than two million
people to the cause of freedom
for slaves. It helped to
unite the North and to give
it strength to stand firm in
the great conflict.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stowe continued writing
in behalf of the slaves.
She gave her son to the cause
of freedom. He was wounded
at Gettysburg and never regained
his health. She aided
in establishing schools for the negroes in the South, and
worked among them earnestly until her death in 1896.</p>

<h3>FRANCES E. WILLARD, THE GREAT TEMPERANCE CRUSADER;
CLARA BARTON, WHO FOUNDED THE RED CROSS SOCIETY
IN AMERICA; AND JANE ADDAMS, THE FOUNDER OF
HULL HOUSE SOCIAL SETTLEMENT IN CHICAGO</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Frances
E. Willard,

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Family

Wisconsin</strong></div>


<p><strong>222. Frances E. Willard.</strong> In 1839, when Frances
Elizabeth Willard was born, thousands were leaving the
eastern states for the new West. Her father and mother
were successful teachers in New York, but when Frances
was two years old they decided to move with the westward
current. After living five years at Oberlin, Ohio,
the family went on to Janesville, Wisconsin, settling on
a farm in the midst of picturesque hills and woods.
There Frances and her brother and sister grew up healthy,
happy children, playing together in the forest and fields.
The parents were religious and were total abstainers, and
the children never forgot their teachings.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Stands
at head
of her
class</strong></div>

<p>At fifteen years of age Frances went to school in Janesville,
and at eighteen to a Milwaukee college for girls.
The following year she entered the Northwestern Female
College at Evanston, Illinois. At graduation she stood
at the head of her class.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Death
breaks
up the
home</strong></div>

<p>Miss Willard began teaching. Then the death of her
sister Mary, and shortly afterward, of her father, broke
up her home. That home had been an ideal one. There
the father and mother were equal in all things, and discussed
together the affairs of the household. It was a
perfect home, orderly and temperate. Frances Willard
made up her mind to spend her life in spreading abroad
a knowledge of such homes, and in helping women to
become equal with men before the law.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>President

<p>In 1874 came the anti-saloon crusade. Miss Willard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
saw that this movement was part of the fight for better
and happier homes, and threw herself ardently into the
work. When the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union
was organized in Chicago,
Miss Willard became
its president.</p>

<p>In 1879 she became the
president of the National
Union. Her work was
never-ending. She wrote
books; she lectured all over
the country. For twelve
years she held an average
of one meeting a day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Favors
woman
suffrage</strong></div>

<p>Miss Willard had seen that unless women had the
right to assist in making laws, their cause was hopeless.
Accordingly she declared herself in favor of woman
suffrage. A few years later the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union followed their leader into politics in an
effort to encourage temperance legislation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Women

<p>Miss Willard's work constantly became wider. The
organization of which she was the head became international
in its influence, and the World's Woman's
Christian Temperance Union was organized in 1883,
with Miss Willard as president. She had united the
women of the world in a great league for the protection
of the home. Miss Willard remained to the end of her
life president of the World's Woman's Christian Temperance
Union. She died in 1898.</p>

<p><strong>223. Clara Barton.</strong> Clara Barton was born in 1821,
near Oxford, Massachusetts. She was educated to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
school teacher, and for many years followed that profession.
In 1861 she visited Washington, and there felt
the impulse that led to her
great life work.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Nurses
the
wounded</strong></div>

<p>The injured soldiers from
the first battles of the Civil
War were being brought to
Washington. Miss Barton
at once felt it her duty to
help in caring for them. She
not only nursed the wounded,
but she encouraged those
who were on the way to the
line of battle.</p>


<p><strong>224. Goes to the Battle
Field.</strong> The men that were
being taken to the hospitals
received no care until they
arrived there. Miss Barton saw that her place was on
the battle field.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Constantly
in
danger</strong></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Received

<p>She secured a pass to the firing line, and for four years
she followed the Union soldiers. She was constantly
in danger; her clothing was pierced by bullets, her face
blackened by powder. But she was undaunted. The
soldiers needed her, and she must be there to help them.
When she could, she nursed wounded Confederate as well
as Federal soldiers. She received no pay for her work.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Red
Cross
Society
in Europe</strong></div>

<p>When the war was over Miss Barton went to Europe.
There she learned of the Red Cross Society, founded in
Geneva in 1863. The purpose of the society was to care
for the wounded of any nation on the field of battle. A
treaty among the nations agreed that the Red Cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
nurses should be safe from capture. Miss Barton was
asked to organize a branch of the Red Cross in the
United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>American
Red
Cross</strong></div>

<p>In 1882 President Arthur signed the treaty, and the
American Red Cross, with Miss Barton as its first president,
was established. She continued as president until
1904, when she resigned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Goes to
Armenia</strong></div>

<p>In 1896 Miss Barton went to Armenia at the head of
her Red Cross to relieve the suffering caused by the massacres.
She saved thousands from starvation and disease.</p>

<p>Again she nobly responded to the call of President
McKinley to go to the help of Cuba in the Spanish-American
War.</p>

<p>Miss Barton lived to see the Red Cross a world-wide
society carrying comfort and cheer to all nations. In
the World War after every great battle the Red Cross
nurses worked on the field or in the hospital to lighten
the awful sufferings of the wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Work of
the

<p><strong>225. The Red Cross Society in Times of Peace.</strong> It
was Miss Barton's firm belief that the world needed the
services of the Red Cross in times of peace as well as in
times of war. Accordingly an amendment was made to
the Geneva treaty. Local Red Cross societies sprang
up in every part of the country. The suffering which
followed the great Charleston earthquake, the Galveston
flood, forest fires, mine explosions, and all similar
accidents found the Red Cross Society on hand with aid
and supplies.</p>

<p>The greatest calamity that has befallen our country

the poor</strong></div>


<p><strong>226. Jane Addams.</strong> There was still another great and
vital field of service waiting for a leader. This was the
cause of a better chance in life for the very poor. A
better understanding among all people, rich and poor, and
a knowledge of the interests which all have in common are
aiding in this. Education, reform of unjust working
conditions, and social service&mdash;the help or relief of poor
or unfortunate people&mdash;are
all means of progress
through which people like
Jane Addams have worked.</p>

<p>In 1883 while traveling
in Europe, Jane Addams,
a daughter of wealthy and
distinguished parents, was
deeply touched by the
terrible poverty and misery
she saw everywhere
around her. She herself
had never known want or
hunger. Indeed she had more wealth than she knew how
to spend for things she herself needed or cared for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Devotes
herself to
social
service</strong></div>

<p>She determined to devote herself and her fortune to a
fairer distribution of the world's goods and pleasures
among those who were always hungry and in want.
It was a vast undertaking, but Miss Addams was not
dismayed. She hoped that some day the rich and the
educated would see that all men are equal and would
unite with the unfortunate in one great brotherhood.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Hull
House
Social
Settlement
founded</strong></div>

<p>She returned to Chicago, and there with a group of
workers established a social settlement in a building in a
poor quarter of the city and called it Hull House.</p>

<p>There everyone, however poor, was welcomed. People
could come there for advice or help. Through personal
influence they were led to become acquainted with the
best books, to cultivate their minds, and to meet each
other at times for study or social enjoyment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The settlement
a
success</strong></div>

<p>Men and women from all parts of the country and
from abroad visited Hull House to see what Miss Addams
and all her fellow-workers, through personal service,
were doing to make the lives of the poor people around
them a little brighter and happier. They found Hull
House a success. The neighborhood was like a great
family whose members sought each other's welfare.
They regarded Miss Addams as one of themselves. This
was a bit of the human brotherhood of which Miss Addams
had dreamed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Greater
opportunities
for
women</strong></div>


<p><strong>227. What Has Been Accomplished.</strong> These great
women of whom we have read have worked for the advancement,
not alone of their sex, but of all mankind in
the United States and the world over.</p>

<p>Through their efforts great changes have taken place
in woman's position. Throughout the country she has
a place more equal to man's in the eyes of the law, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
unlimited opportunities in education and business, and
whatever openings in public life she proves fitted for.
Now looking back, we can see that the greater part of
what Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony
so relentlessly strove for has been gained. Woman suffrage
will doubtless soon cause the more backward states
to give women full legal rights, and it will also enable
women to work more freely for the progress of the nation.</p>

<h3>HOW FARM AND FACTORY HELPED BUILD THE NATION</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>The great
cotton
crop
of the
southern
states</strong></div>


<p><strong>228. Cotton Fields and Cotton Factories.</strong> Since the
days of Eli Whitney cotton has been grown in all the
southern states from Virginia westward to Texas, and
from the Gulf of Mexico north to Missouri. More than
one half of all the cotton in the world is grown in southern
United States. High-grade cotton is also grown in California,
Arizona, and New Mexico, and California is now
one of our leading cotton-producing states.</p>

<p>A field of growing cotton is very picturesque. Its
culture employs many laborers. The number of laborers
needed, however, is not the same throughout the year.
In the fall, when the bolls ripen, all hands, large and small,
pick cotton. This work takes several months. Then the
picked cotton is put through a gin which is still built along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
the lines of Whitney's invention. The cleaned cotton is
pressed into large bales and is then ready for market.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Cotton-seed
oil</strong></div>

<p>The cotton seed goes to one mill, the cotton to another.
For many years the seed was wasted. Farmers burned
it or threw it away. But now in all parts of the South
great mills crush the seed and make from it a valuable
oil. What is left is cotton-seed cake, and is bought
eagerly by cattle growers everywhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Cotton
mills
in the
South</strong></div>

<p>Only a few years ago almost all the cotton grown in
the South was shipped away, either to Europe or to
New England. In Massachusetts and Rhode Island
cotton mills employ more people than any other industry,
and great cities are supported almost entirely by manufacturing
cotton goods. Now the South has also discovered
that it can spin and weave its cotton at home.
About many of its waterfalls is heard the hum of busy
cotton mills. New cities
are growing up, and prosperity
has returned to the
South.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Wheat
belt
west
of the
Mississippi</strong></div>


<p><strong>229. The Grain that
Feeds the Nation.</strong> From
the days of the early colonists,
wheat has been
one of the most valuable
crops produced in this
country. In the states
east of the Mississippi
River the farmers have
long raised it in connection
with a variety of other crops. But as the newer
lands west of this river were taken up, the settlers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
discovered that in that region wheat yielded more
abundantly than any other crop.</p>

<p>From Kansas northward to Minnesota and western
Canada lies a broad stretch of land which has cool spring
weather and a light rainfall. This is the climate best
suited to wheat, and here has developed the great wheat
belt of America.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Traction
engines</strong></div>

<p>In this region there are vast wheat fields almost
everywhere, stretching farther than the eye can see
over the level surface. Most of the farms are very large,
some of them including many thousands of acres. The
work on these places is done with the most modern
machines. Traction engines are used to pull the great
plows, the largest of which turn fifty furrows at a time.
In harvest time an army of reaping and binding machines
harvests the golden grain. The harvesting machine and
the thresher have also been combined. On some of the
greatest farms a huge complex machine makes its way
through the standing grain, leaving behind it rows of
bags, filled with threshed grain ready for the market.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Grain
elevators</strong></div>

<p>With the aid of such machinery a few people can
cultivate a great many acres. As a result, the country
is thinly settled. The towns are few and far between.
In most of them the principal building is the grain elevator,
which holds the grain until it is ready to be shipped.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Flour
mills</strong></div>

<p>From the elevators the wheat goes to the flour mills.
The largest of these are in Minneapolis, in the eastern
part of the wheat belt. The flour in its turn goes to feed
the many millions of people in all parts of the country.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Grain
exports
decrease</strong></div>

<p>For many years this country grew much more wheat
than we needed, and we shipped great quantities to
Europe. But each year our growing population needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
more food, and our exports of this grain decrease steadily.
Even now our farms grow but little more of this grain
than is needed at
home, and the time
is almost at hand
when we shall no
longer send any of
it abroad.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Texas
and
Iowa
lead</strong></div>


<p><strong>230. Cattle
Raising and Meat
Packing.</strong> Cattle
raising, like wheat
farming, is principally
an industry of the West. As late as 1850 the states
which raised the most cattle lay along the Atlantic
coast. But to-day Texas and Iowa are in the lead, and
Kansas and Nebraska follow closely.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Cattle
ranches
of the
West</strong></div>

<p>As the eastern states became peopled more densely,
cattle grazing was forced west. The cattle pastures
were broken up into fields. The prairies of Illinois and
Iowa became a vast cornfield. Eastern Kansas and
Nebraska were turned into corn and wheat farms. Always
the cattle had to give way to the grain. At last
the farmers came to a strip of country where the rainfall
was not enough to make grain growing profitable. This
comparatively narrow strip stretches north in an irregular
area of plains from western Texas to Montana. This
region grows fine grass and has become the great grazing
country of the United States. Here vast herds of cattle
still roam on large ranches and are cared for by cowboys.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Corn-fed
cattle</strong></div>

<p>East of the ranch country lies the corn belt, in which
Illinois and Iowa are the leading states. Cattle fatten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
better on corn than on any other food, and the meat of
corn-fed stock brings the best prices.</p>

<p>The corn states have therefore taken up the raising
and fattening of cattle on a tremendous scale. When
western cattle leave the ranch they are generally not
very heavy. Thousands of carloads are shipped into the
corn country each year, there to be fattened before going
to the packing houses.</p>

<p>The Department of Agriculture, at Washington, is
now taking great pains to induce the boys, especially
of the South, to make experiments in corn raising.
Some wonderful results have been produced, and the
South is in a fair way to take to the raising of corn.</p>

belt at Chicago, Kansas City, Omaha, and other cities.
To-day meat packing is the greatest business of Chicago
and many other large cities. A generation ago it had
scarcely begun. But the packers learned to can meat,
to use ice for cold storage, and, most important of all,
the refrigerator car was invented.</p>

<p>By this last discovery it became possible to ship meat
almost everywhere. Where before the packers had to sell
their goods at home, now they have the world as a market.
A steer raised on the western prairies may now be
fattened for market in Illinois, slaughtered in Chicago,
and served in New York, or sent to England or even to
the Orient.</p>

<h3>MINES, MINING, AND MANUFACTURES</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Great
value
of coal
and iron</strong></div>


<p><strong>231. Coal and Iron.</strong> Next to the great farm crops,
coal and iron are the most valuable products of our
country. The coal that is mined in one year is worth
five times as much as the gold and silver combined. Our
iron mines yield as much wealth in one year as the gold
mines do in three. Gold and silver are luxuries without
which we could get along, but our great factories, railroads,
and steamship lines could not exist without an
abundance of iron and coal.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago there was almost no coal mined
in this country. Now we use more of it than any other
land, and almost a million men make a living by mining it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Hard
coal in
Pennsylvania</strong></div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Factories
need coal</strong></div>

<p>At first most of the coal produced was the hard anthracite
of eastern Pennsylvania. But this hard coal is
found only in one small section of Pennsylvania, whereas
great beds of soft coal stretch from Pennsylvania west
to Washington. At present there is far more soft coal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
used than anthracite. Pennsylvania is the leading state
in the production of both hard and soft coal, but West
Virginia, Illinois, and Ohio are also great coal states.
Generally, where there are productive coal mines, factories
have been built, because most of them need a great deal
of coal for fuel.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Largest
iron-ore
deposits
in the
world</strong></div>

<p>Iron was first worked by the colonists in the bogs of
New England. Iron mining, however, did not become
a great industry until the latter part of the last century.
In that period the great iron "ranges" of Lake Superior
were opened up. These are the largest deposits of iron
ore in the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Carried
to the
smelters</strong></div>

<p>Most of the ore lies in Minnesota. Here, far up in the
northern woods, thousands of men are blasting or digging
out the red and rusty ore. Huge steam shovels load a
car in a few minutes, and in a short while a trainload of
ore is on its way to Duluth or Superior. From there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
it is carried by steamer east, most likely to one of the
Ohio towns on Lake Erie. Here much of the ore is again
loaded into cars and hauled to the Pittsburgh region,
there to be smelted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Coal and
iron
support
great industries</strong></div>

<p>Pittsburgh has become the greatest iron and steel
center of America. Enormous quantities of coal are
mined here and used for smelting the iron ore that is
shipped in. More people of western Pennsylvania and
eastern Ohio make a living by mining coal and making
steel and iron than anywhere else in America. Great
blast furnaces melt the iron ore. Steel works turn out
huge quantities of rail and sheet steel. Foundries make
cast-iron products of all kinds. Vast shops are busily
engaged in producing locomotives and machines of endless
variety. Everywhere in this region are smoking chimneys
and busy industrial plants, all supported by coal
and iron. The southern states, Alabama, the Carolinas,
Georgia, and Tennessee, also contain rich stores of coal
and iron. These resources were little used during slavery
days. Now, however, the southern states are digging
coal for use in their great factories and cotton mills,
or sending it abroad. Birmingham, Alabama, is one of
the great coal and iron centers of the United States.</p>

<p><em>In the "Food Will Win the War" campaign posters
urged all school children to make gardens</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The war was so big that if each citizen had not done
his bit, Germany might have conquered. The work
of shipping boards and
directors of fuel supply
was less important than
the work done by ordinary
people. Much was
done to win the war in
the homes of each boy
and girl in the United
States as well as on the
battlefields of France.
Every member of the
family found things he
could do without to
help buy more Liberty
bonds. Boy Scouts sold
bonds and thrift stamps.
Girls worked to get food-card
pledges. Mothers
planned the meals carefully
to save the wheat, meat, and sugar that had to be
sent across to our army. Brothers and fathers had to
answer the draft call and go to training camps if necessary.
Not only must food and money, gasoline and coal,
be saved, but everyone who could not fight overseas was
expected to do some useful work.</p>

<p>With one hundred million people in the country, we
might think it would not make any difference if we let
someone else do our part. But this was not the spirit
of America. For the most part, each person himself
felt that this was <em>his</em> war, fought for <em>his</em> rights and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
<em>his</em> aims. And because for the most part each person
acted as if success depended on him, Europe was amazed
at America's swiftness in getting ready to fight.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>America
by
tradition
aloof</strong></div>

<p>The United States did not decide to enter this war until
it had been going on nearly three years, for its people
had come from nations fighting on opposite sides. Besides,
war had always been a common happening in Europe, and
the United States had always tried to keep its hands free.
Washington and Jefferson and later Monroe had advised
that we should only be "interested spectators" of quarrels
abroad.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
powers
involved</strong></div>


<p><strong>233. A World at Arms.</strong> The outbreak of the war
surprised the world by its suddenness. The heir to the
throne of Austria, Archduke Ferdinand, was murdered
in June, 1914. Austria blamed Serbia for the murder.
When Serbia would not agree to all that was demanded of
her, Austria at once declared war. The largest nations
of Europe were united in two groups. Germany took up
Austria's quarrel; Russia, France, and England combined
to oppose Germany. Italy was bound to defend
Germany and Austria if they should be attacked, but now
believed they were the attacking nations, and later came
in against them. Bulgaria and Turkey threw in their
lot with Germany and Austria, these four nations forming
the Central Powers, and Japan and Roumania with
the Allies, as the nations opposing them were called.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Invasion
of
Belgium</strong></div>

<p>Germany's first act was to rush her troops across the
borders of Belgium, straight toward Paris. Belgium, of
course, was too small a state to stand against the armies
of her stronger neighbors. On this account the great
nations of western Europe had agreed never to invade
Belgium, and now England felt bound to go to her defense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Events
at sea</strong></div>

<p>British, French, and Belgian soldiers, fighting in whatever
order they could, checked the on-coming masses of
Germans. The Allies stopped them at the Battle of the
Marne, far within France. On the sea England's mighty
navy quickly put an end to all German shipping. She
kept the German navy from venturing even into the North
Sea. But German submarines could not be so easily
blocked up, and slipped out and sunk Allied vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Opinion

<p><strong>234. The American Government Neutral.</strong> When
Germany first attacked Belgium, some people believed
that the United States should break off relations with
her at once. Our government declared itself neutral.
President Wilson asked the people to be friendly in their
dealings with all the nations at war. But Germany's
headlong haste in declaring war, and her methods of
waging it made most Americans anxious for the success
of the Allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Germany
protests</strong></div>

<p>The European countries were too busy fighting to raise
all the food or forge all the guns their armies needed.
They were producing these things on a very great scale,
but had to buy vast quantities besides. The United
States was the country best able to supply them. The
great steel factories of the country worked night and day
making shells, tanks, and war material of all kinds. Since
England controlled the seas, everything we made went to
the Allies. Germany protested strongly against our supplying
her enemies with the means to fight her. But
America, not being at war, had a right to trade with all
countries. To give up this right would have been to take
sides with Germany. American merchants were willing
to manufacture goods for Germany, but she could not send
ships to get them.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE LUSITANIA</p></div>
</div>


<p><strong>235. Disputes with England and Germany.</strong> Our government
had a just cause of complaint against England.
Her acts were not
always strictly lawful.
She stopped
our ships on the
high seas and
searched them, destroying
mail which
she thought was intended for Germany. When the United
States objected, she promised to make good all losses.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Lusitania</strong></div>

<p>Germany, on the other hand, not only destroyed American
goods but American lives. One of the two largest
passenger ships ever built, the <em>Lusitania</em>, was sunk by
a German submarine on May 7, 1915. Over one hundred
Americans went down. Again there was a great cry
that Germany should be punished. But President Wilson
made every possible effort for peace. He gave Germany
a chance to prove that she did not mean to continue such
lawlessness. Finally Germany promised to take Americans
off the ships to be sunk. In spite of her pledge
Germany failed to change her methods. New notes
protesting and more ships sunk was the order of things
for almost two years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A peace-loving
nation</strong></div>

<p>President Wilson was severely criticized for this "warfare
of notes." But many people were not yet convinced
that this was different from other European wars. Otherwise
Congress, which like the President is the servant of
the people, might have declared war sooner. The country
was peace-loving, and far away from roaring guns and
ruined towns of Europe. In a way it is to the credit of
the American people that they were slow to believe in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
the world-wide plots of the Kaiser, and the reported
cruelty of his soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>United

<p><strong>236. The Need of a United Nation.</strong> President Wilson
sought to be a true public servant, by listening to the
opinions of people throughout the land. He did not try
to lead the nation into war while the feelings of the
people were still divided. A divided people could have
done little in this gigantic war.</p>

<p>His training made him able to understand the temper
of the American people well. He was a student
of history, and the author of well-known books on the
American government.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Wilson's
boyhood</strong></div>

<p>President Wilson's boyhood was much like that of any
other boy. In his classes he was neither brilliant nor slow.
He took part in all regular school sports, and at Davidson
College once saved the day for his team in baseball.
Later at Princeton and Johns Hopkins, two of the most
famous eastern universities, he studied history and
economics. At the age of twenty-three he began a book
called <em>Congressional Government</em>, which shows his command
of words and thorough knowledge of his subject.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>WOODROW WILSON</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Governor
of New
Jersey</strong></div>

<p>He had tried practicing law, but did not make a success
of it and decided to be a teacher. In this he is like many
other Americans who have failed in their first undertaking,
and have later been successful in a different line. He
taught first at Bryn Mawr, a woman's college near
Philadelphia, then at Wesleyan, the old Methodist university,
then at Princeton. "Princeton, Trenton, Washington"&mdash;Wilson's
career has been jokingly summed up,
for he was in turn chosen president of Princeton, governor
of New Jersey, whose capital Trenton is, and President of
the United States. On the whole, his record at Princeton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
and Trenton, and as President during his first term,
was that of a liberal and fearless chief. The elections of
1916 came at a critical time
and President Wilson was
reëlected partly because "he
kept us out of war." Banners
with this motto on them were
largely used in the campaign.
The American nation did not
have that "warlike spirit"
of loving war for war's sake
which the Kaiser boasted of
in his people.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A
Mexican
Crisis</strong></div>

<p>In 1913 Mexico had been so
upset that it looked as though
the United States might be
drawn into a clash with her.
President Wilson avoided this
except when our soldiers
landed at Vera Cruz for a short time. Later General
John J. Pershing was sent down to Mexico to punish
Villa and his outlaw bands. He killed many of Villa's
followers, but the wily old fox himself escaped.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Germany's
lawless
acts</strong></div>

<p>After the <em>Lusitania</em> was sunk, the submarine warfare
grew more widespread and reckless month by month.
In January, 1917, Germany openly declared that in the
future she would not limit this warfare by any rules
whatever. She aimed to cut off all supplies from Great
Britain and to starve her people. She gave America
one little port among the British Isles where the United
States might send her passengers and commerce. Secret
agents of the Central Powers had been blowing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
factories in the United States, and purchasing newspapers
to defend the German cause. Their treacherous acts
had already caused President Wilson to dismiss the
German ambassador.</p>

<p>Germany's statement that hereafter her submarines
would know no law at last proved to all the nation that
America could not honorably remain out of the war.</p>

<h3>AMERICA ENTERS TO WIN</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Loans to
the Allies</strong></div>


<p><strong>237. Congress Votes Billions.</strong> Congress voted billions
of money to be spent in various ways, and President
Wilson loaned millions of dollars to England,
France, and Italy. They in turn sent great men to talk
with those who were managing our war preparations.</p>

<p>Never did a nation given to peace turn so quickly to
war. Thousands of Americans in Europe had already
been taking part for years. Some had joined the Canadian
army or the Lafayette Squadron, part of the French
air service. Others were working under the Red Cross
or the American Committee for the Relief of Belgium.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Hoover
as food
administrator</strong></div>

<p>Other measures necessary to "mobilize" the nation
were quickly passed. The railroads were put under the
control of a director-general of railroads, who ran them
first of all in the service of the army. A fuel administrator
decided what factories and businesses were most
necessary in the war and in the life of the nation. Others
had to limit their use of coal, or to close down entirely
for a short time. Herbert Hoover, head of the great
committee which had charge of feeding the starving
people of Belgium, was made food administrator. On
one hand, he decided how much food whole nations
could buy of us. On the other, he helped American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
housewives plan their daily meals to save the wheat,
meat, and fat that were needed for the soldiers, because
food would "win the war."</p>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>An army
of
millions</strong></div>


<p><strong>238. The Selective Draft.</strong> Millions of soldiers would
have been America's share of the Allied fighting forces if
the war had gone on longer. Congress decided that a
"Selective Draft" would be the most fair and just method
of raising these millions. All men between the ages of
twenty-one and thirty, and later between nineteen and
forty-five, had to be examined by "Draft Boards," and
the proper number selected.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Great
training
camps
built</strong></div>

<p>Immense training camps were built, with railroad lines,
electric light and water systems, and all the needs of a
modern city. Many of these camps sprang up in a few
months, ready to take care of fifty thousand men apiece.</p>


<p><strong>239. The War's Nameless Heroes.</strong> All these great
preparations at home were more businesslike than they
were stirring and warlike. They meant a great change
in the life of the whole nation. Workers were shifted
from all kinds of small, unimportant peace-time tasks to
a few gigantic businesses on which the success of the war
depended. All the efforts of the nation were centered
on saving goods, time, and money, and producing goods
to carry on the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Not a war
of great
names</strong></div>

<p>The "home front" did not give great honors to those
who held it. But the war was fought to preserve the
rights of free citizens, and it had the nearly united support
of a whole people. There are few famous names in the
fighting abroad, and few, too, at home. It was a war in
which the average man was the hero. He did not expect
medals for doing his duty in battle, or a high salary for
doing his duty at home. But he did it, and unbelievable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
deeds were accomplished&mdash;fleets built, factories multiplied,
waste lands planted, two million men sent across
the seas, and the war brought to a swift end.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Burial of
an "Unknown
Warrior"</strong></div>

<p>England had a great state funeral not long ago. It
rivaled in ceremony the honors paid to dead queens and
kings. Throngs followed the great procession to Westminster
Abbey, where England's famous dead of all time
are buried. A tablet was placed above the tomb of a
hero whom a nation united to give its highest honors.
The name on that tablet was "To an Unknown Warrior."
In America, too, the deeds of the great number, in battle
or at home, will always be nameless.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
spirit of
heroism
needed
in peace</strong></div>

<p>If each person, instead of looking straight ahead at the
task to be done, had looked to see who else could do it,
America's war program would have failed. It has been
said that in a great nation any one person, by himself,
is lost, and does not count. The chapter in American
history just ended proves that when his country is in
danger, each citizen can and must act as if the result
depended on him. This spirit of patriotism among millions
of those whom history will call nameless heroes
brought victory in the war, and if it is still followed in
peace, will bring "victories no less renowned."</p>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>An unparalleled
war</strong></div>


<p><strong>240. The World's Greatest War.</strong> The war of 1914-1918
is the greatest history has ever known, because of
the number of nations in it, the number of lives lost, the
cost in goods and money, and the changes it has made
among nations.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A record
in shipbuilding</strong></div>

<p>Its size is too vast for any one mind to picture it fully.
The front-line trenches, with all their turns and twists,
were six hundred miles long, nearly equal to the straight
distance from Philadelphia to Chicago. Mountains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
material had to be sent across to keep our soldiers well
fed and warmly clothed, and furnished with the cannon
and shells they
must have to
meet the enemy.
Only about two
out of three men
in the army could
fight, for the third
man had to keep
these mammoth
quantities of supplies
steadily
moving toward
the front. Ships were the thing our government needed
most, since it was fighting so far away from home. American
shipyards grew so rapidly that they broke all records
for number of ships launched and swiftness in building
them. The United States soon led the world in shipbuilding
for this war.</p>

<p>The War Department was so anxious to keep our men
warm and comfortable that it bought up all the wool in
the country. The army had to have thirty-five million
more pairs of woolen socks than were made for the whole
nation in 1914. It used more woolen blankets in one
year than the one hundred million people in the United
States buy in two ordinary years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Attacks
carefully
planned</strong></div>


<p><strong>241. A War of Science.</strong> Every movement in the war
had to be planned as exactly as possible. This was a
war of science, rather than a war of dashing adventure,
as those in the past had been. Before attacks were made
on the enemy, a barrage, or curtain-like rain of shells,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
was turned on his lines. This "curtain of fire" moved
forward at a fixed rate, and the men walked behind it.
They had strict orders to go only so many yards a minute,
or their own guns would kill them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Use of
poison
gas</strong></div>

<p>Poison gas was one of the new weapons of this war.
It caused almost one-third of our losses in 1918. Science
produced new gases so rapidly that inventors had to be
continually making new gas masks to strain out the
deadly fumes. Over thirty kinds of gas were used during
the war.</p>

<p>No one commander could be present at once on every
part of the hundreds of miles of battle-lines, or even a
small part of them. The war had to be carried on largely
by telephone. The Americans strung one hundred thousand
miles of wire in France.</p>

<p><strong>242. Pershing Heads the Army.</strong> The youngest of
American generals, John Joseph Pershing, was put at
the head of the American forces. The choice of Pershing
was hailed everywhere as a wise one. A war so immense
and mechanical
needed a general
who had studied
the art of war
thoroughly, as
Pershing had. He
had seen much
actual fighting,
and was the only
American general who had commanded a division in
actual war. He carried with him the love and respect of
all national guardsmen. They would have followed him
anywhere he wished to lead.</p>

<p>We have already heard how he had routed Villa's

troops against the Spaniards
in Cuba, and had conquered
a powerful savage tribe in the
Philippines. Before he was
sent to Mexico he had been
governor of a province in the
Philippines for four years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Fights

<p><strong>243. A Boy Who Was
Made of Fighting Stuff.</strong> As a
boy, Pershing was brave and
modest, with the ability to
stay by a hard task until he
finished it. John was a hardy,
active boy. He played at
mimic war and attended
school. He played "hookey,"
and got into fights with his fellows, but he was square.
One day the father saw the signs of battle-torn clothes
and a bruised face. "Been fighting? Never let any boy
say that he has licked you," was the father's remark.
John had expected a whipping.</p>

<p>At day school he was a plodder. But he did win a
prize, a nicely bound volume of the <em>Life of Washington</em>.
This was offered by the president of the school board.
John's mother was there. The children clapped and
called for a speech. "I'm sorry you didn't all win a
prize. I'm going to grow up like Washington," he said.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Studies

Point</strong></div>

<p>In the 70's, when times were bad, John had to help
earn the family living, and he did it by teaching some
of the hardest schools in the district. He took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
examinations for West Point when he was twenty, and
defeated his friend. "I'm sorry you could not win too,"
he said. At the end of his first year at West Point he
was made class leader, a position won only by hard study.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Made a

<p>After he graduated from West Point, honors and promotions
came fast. Roosevelt had passed by eight hundred

At the beginning of the war he was major general, and
later Congress promoted him to the full rank of general, a
very rare honor, and the highest in its power to give.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Arrival

<p>When Pershing, with a few officers and engineers first

New life and fresh resolution came into the hearts of the
war-tired veterans of France.</p>

about the time the United States entered, a revolution
drove the Czar from his throne. Russia was so upset by
the revolution that after a year it gave up trying to keep
its army at the front, and made peace with Germany.
Hundreds of thousands of German soldiers were thus left
free to attack the Allies in the west. Germany thought that
if she could succeed in taking Paris before many Americans
arrived in the trenches, the war would be won. It was
her last chance to win.</p>

<p><strong>245. Foch the Allied Supreme Commander.</strong> Before
the spring of 1918 each of the Allied armies had been acting
on its own plan. The places where the trenches of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
armies came together were, of course, the weakest, and
were favorite points for German attacks. It was now
decided to have one commander for all the Allied forces.
Foch, a French general highly skilled in the science of
war, was chosen for this great task.</p>

<p><strong>246. The Crisis of the War.</strong> In their great drive the
Germans always struck at the weakest point. They found
this where the French and English armies were joined.
They drove forward in mass formations or solid blocks.
Thousands upon thousands were mowed down by the
English and French guns, but on they came. Back, back
the Allies fell, day after day, until the Germans reached the
Marne again. The world held its breath. Each day the
Germans were expected to break through, but each day
the Allied troops retreated. Slowly they moved, fighting
like demons and always holding at vital points.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>American
troops

<p>America was eager to be of the greatest possible help
in the grave danger to Paris and France. The Allies were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
short of reserves. General Pershing, putting his own
honors second in the same generous way he had done at
school, decided to scatter the Yankee troops all through
the French and British lines, wherever they were
needed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Rushing
troops to
France</strong></div>

<p>Germany had sneered at our nation because she thought
our people were so devoted to dollars that we could not
or would not fight. Now she began to learn how high the
war spirit flamed in the soldiers we were preparing to send
by millions to France. By the help of England's great
fleet, we were able to send over more than a million men
by the summer of 1918. The American troops then
formed a united army, fighting under their own flag.
They took over a hundred miles of the front, relieving
tired Frenchmen. Another million arrived by November.</p>

<p>The Allied command gave Pershing command of the
region between the Aisne and the Marne. The Germans
thought the Americans untried, and expected to break
through by using their best "shock troops."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
battle of
Château-Thierry</strong></div>

<p>In July the Germans struck a terrific blow at Château-Thierry.
Without waiting for artillery, Pershing struck,
and in six hours had captured as much ground as the
Germans had spent six days in getting possession of.
The Americans were advancing with great rapidity.
The Germans were dumbfounded. They did not have
time to remove their supplies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The turning
point
of the war</strong></div>

<p>By the brilliant generalship of Foch the great German
attack was stopped in the middle of July, and after that
it was the German army which was in danger.</p>

<p>Now Pershing got ready for St. Mihiel. He drew
from the French and English ranks the Americans he
had sent to learn war from these veterans. Now he also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
had tried men. St. Mihiel was important. It threatened
the famous battlefield of Verdun and protected the
great German fortified city of Metz.</p>

<p><strong>247. Germans Cry "Kamerad."</strong> On September 12
the Americans burst forth in a rain of shot and shell such
as the Germans had seldom before witnessed. The fierce
battle raged for four hours. The Americans then
charged across the river yelling like demons. The
German soldiers had been taught to despise these "green
American troops." But these same Germans now cried
"Kamerad" in dead earnest. Five miles of ground were
gained before these "green" Americans halted.</p>

<p>The next day our artillery opened fire at 1:30 in the
morning. Before the day was done, more than one
hundred and fifty square miles of German territory were
in our possession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<p>Both the French and the English were busy. The
French were driving at the center of the great line stretching
from the North Sea to Switzerland. The English
were driving the Germans out of the Belgian cities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
greatest
American
battle</strong></div>


<p><strong>248. Battle of the Argonne.</strong> Many large battles were
fought by the Americans, besides the smaller clashes that
occurred. The greatest one was in the Argonne Forest.
This was a half-mountainous, woody country, much of
which was covered with underbrush. The Germans had
fortified it strongly. Besides their great cannon, they had
filled the Argonne with nests of machine guns, placing them
in gullies and behind trees, stumps, and rocks, for protection.
Here too, they had their best fighting men.</p>

<p>The battle started on September 26. This was the
most bloody fighting of the war. Companies and regiments
were cut off and lost for a time. The Germans
were bound to hold the forest, and the Americans were
bound to win it. Gradually the Germans were forced
back, thousands were captured, and thousands more were
killed. They could not stem the American tide. After
many days of hard fighting in which the Americans
proved themselves fully equal to the best shock troops
of the German army, victory fell to the better army.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Allied

<p>The storm was just breaking loose on Germany. The
combined navy of the Allies was choking out her life in
spite of the submarines. The English in Asia were capturing
the strongholds of the Turks, and the Italians
now were gaining against the Austrians. Calamities
came fast. Bulgaria, an ally of Germany, surrendered.
Turkey followed. The hungry people of Germany began
to plot revolution against their rulers, and the armies
were retreating toward the Rhine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span></p>


<p><strong>249. The Kaiser Runs Away.</strong> Seeing that his cause
was lost, the German ruler, the Kaiser, gave up his throne
and fled to Holland. The German generals agreed to
an armistice November 11, 1918, by which they gave
up much fighting material and moved back many miles
across the Rhine into their own land.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

<p><strong>250. American Soldiers in Battle.</strong> The American
doughboys were splendid fighters. The officers had to
check the rash daring of their men, they did not need to
urge them forward. The Americans were drilled in methods
of attack rather than defense, from the start. A joking
comment was made that it took only half as long to
train American troops as it did others, because they only
had to be taught to go one way.</p>

<p>The ordinary American showed what courage lay behind
the quiet round of his peace-time life. Our soldiers were
clean and full of high spirits, and they were keyed to the
most stubborn efforts by knowing that they were not
fighting in a selfish cause. They "fraternized" famously
with the French children of the villages.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Work of

<p><strong>251. The Treaty of Peace.</strong> After the armistice, the
nations which had won the victory planned to meet at
Paris to make a treaty of peace. President Wilson went
over to France to take part in this meeting.</p>

<p>The men who made the peace treaty gave France her
two states, Alsace and Lorraine, which Germany had
taken in the war of 1870. They divided Austria into
a number of separate states, giving to each kind of people
its own government. They took land from Germany and
Russia and created Poland. They also decided that Germany
should pay Belgium and France for the destruction
of property in those countries.</p>

<p><strong>252. America and the League of Nations.</strong> Included
in the treaty was an agreement called the League of
Nations. Its purpose was to combine all nations, great
and small, in a covenant which would work for the peace
of the world. The need of a league was urged by men of
different parties in this country during the war. A great
number of Americans were in favor of such a world agreement.
This country had always been a peace-loving
people, and had fought in the hope that this would be a
war to end war. But after the armistice Europe remained
more unsettled than anyone had expected. In spite of all
the treaties, wars of various kinds continued in Europe.
President Wilson toured the country speaking for the
League, but met much opposition. The American people
came to believe that under the League they would be too
closely bound up with European affairs, which were now
so disturbed.</p>

<p>In 1920 the question of entering the League in its
original form was widely debated. It was the chief point
on which the presidential election turned, and the result
was overwhelmingly against the League as it had been
drawn up at Paris.</p>

<p><strong>253. Why Boys and Girls Should Know about Europe.</strong>
In the part of the book just studied, you have become
acquainted with men and women who have been great
American leaders. Did you ever stop to think that the
early settlers in this country, from whom most of our great
men sprang, came from countries in Europe already built
up? What the settlers gave to this country they got
from people who had lived a long time ago. Therefore
in many ways their habits and institutions were different
from ours now. They had their own ways of living,
their own schools, churches, and forms of government.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
rulers</strong></div>

<p>In most European countries kings and queens ruled the
people. Next to the king stood the lords, who were great
men and owned acres and acres of land. They had their
own soldiers and many servants to do their work and to
wait on them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
serfs</strong></div>

<p>Below the lords, who spent their time in war, in the
chase, and in going to see play-battles, called mock-fights,
were the common people. In some countries these
people were not
free, as you are,
but lived in huts
in small villages
on the great
man's land.
They had to
work on his land, and were only a little better off than
slaves. These people were called serfs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span></p>

<p>In the few large cities there lived at that time rich merchants
who traded in slaves, or went on long journeys
to buy and sell their wares. In the cities, too, lived
workers in wool, cotton, brass, iron, wood, and other
materials. After a time the workers of a given class
gathered into a sort of union called a guild, to protect
themselves.</p>

<h3>THE OLDEST NATIONS</h3>


<p><strong>254. Egypt, the Land of the Nile and the Pyramids.</strong>
Egypt has always been a land of curious things. It lies
across the Mediterranean, southeast of Europe. It is a
land of sunshine day after day. Were it not for the Nile
River, it would be a part of the Great Sahara Desert.
Every year for ages, the Nile has risen in a great flood and
its waters have spread out over Egypt. In coming down
from their mountain home these waters carry rich earth
which they spread over a part of Egypt. The result is
that Egypt, in an early day, became the garden spot for
nations less favored.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Egypt in
Bible
times</strong></div>

<p>Many of you can recall the Bible story of Joseph's
brethren who were sent down into Egypt to buy corn
because there was a famine in their land. Thanks to the
Nile, there was plenty of corn in Egypt. The people of
Egypt were among the first of the world's farmers and
gardeners of which history has any record.</p>

<p><strong>255. Irrigation Systems of the Egyptians.</strong> In a great
many parts of western United States where little rain
falls, how do farmers and gardeners get water for their
plants? "Irrigation" is the word that tells the story.
The Egyptians taught the people of the world how to save
water for irrigation by building great dams in the Nile.
This water they carried in ditches throughout the land so
that the thirsty crops would have the moisture they needed
for growing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

the kings</strong></div>


<p><strong>256. Egypt Ruled by Kings.</strong> For several thousand
years Egypt was ruled by kings. The most famous of
these rulers was a great warrior called Rameses II. He
built great tombs or monuments called "pyramids."
These were built out of huge blocks of stone much larger
than any now used in buildings. For many years he had
the common man or the slave doing this work for him.</p>

<p>The Bible tells us about Moses, who became a great
leader among the Israelites. The Israelites were slaves
to the kings of Egypt. Moses led them forth from Egypt
to escape the hard tasks of one of their kings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span></p>


<p><strong>257. What the Egyptians Gave to Other Nations.</strong>
Among the Egyptians there were great students for that
early time. A few men among them studied the stars
and learned about the movements of the heavenly bodies.
In arithmetic they could count up to millions. They
could weave cloth, cut jewels, and make most beautiful
objects out of glass.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Egyptian
hieroglyphics</strong></div>

<p>But above all the Egyptians could write. Not as we
do, of course, but they used letters, not rude pictures as
seen in most early writings. Scholars have named the
characters used in writing by Egyptians and other
ancient peoples "hieroglyphics."</p>


<p><strong>258. Babylon and Nineveh.</strong> Asia, too, had early
peoples. Perhaps some of them were older than the
Egyptians. There lived in southwestern Asia, in the
valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, two mighty
nations whose chief cities were Babylon and Nineveh.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
hanging
gardens
of
Babylon</strong></div>

<p>Babylon on the Euphrates was a splendid city. It
had great walls to protect it against enemy nations. Its
hanging gardens were the wonders of the ancient world.</p>

<p>To the north, on the banks of the Tigris, lay the great
city of Nineveh. The fierce kings of Nineveh conquered
many nations and forced them to pay tribute.</p>

<p>In this region, nature furnished the kings no building
stone such as was found in Egypt. But they made their
homes and their palaces out of sun-dried brick. This soft
material, as the years rolled on, fell into decay, and now
men can find the ruins of these wonderful cities only by
digging where they lay.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>How the
Babylonians
wrote</strong></div>

<p>The Babylonians did their writing upon bricks or clay
tablets before they dried them. They had their own
way of writing, using a sharp piece of metal for making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
wedged-shaped lines instead of letters. They used a
sort of picture-writing too, making rude cuts of birds,
animals, and man. On these clay tablets, buried centuries
ago, we may read the stories of what they did and how
they lived.</p>

<p><strong>259. How Jews and Phoenicians Helped Mankind.</strong>
Along the eastern end of the Mediterranean lies Palestine,
which was conquered by the Jews early
in their history, and became their home.
The Jews as a people interest us because
they have given us our religious ideas.
They have never been a warlike nation,
but at times they could fight. David was
one of their great kings, and Solomon
another.</p>

<p>During long years this people has held
faithful and true to the idea of one God.
Although the Jews were driven from Palestine
and scattered among the nations of
the world they have never given up their
religion. They have always looked forward
to the time when they might return to
Jerusalem and set up a Jewish nation once
more. As a result of the World War that
time seems to have come.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Phoenicians
helped to
advance
learning</strong></div>

<p>The Phoenicians were akin to the Jews.
They lived near the Jews on the Mediterranean
and were a sea-going people, the
traders of that early time. In their ships,
driven by oar and sail, they braved the dangers of the
Atlantic and reached Spain and England. To these people
must be given the credit of carrying to the Greeks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
Romans much of the learning of Egypt and Asia. To
the Phoenicians also belongs the honor and fame of
inventing an alphabet much like the one we have to-day,
although with fewer letters.</p>

Black Sea. Some of these colonies became rich and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>

He told how Paris, son of the king of Troy, stole Helen,
the wife of the king of a Greek city called Sparta.
Helen was said to be the most beautiful woman in the
ancient world.</p>

<p>The king of Sparta called upon all Greeks for help.
From every city of Greece came bold warriors. The
Trojans were great fighters, too. For nine years war was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>

quarreled among themselves and the Trojans drove them

god Vulcan, rushed forth and slew Hector, leader of the
Trojans. There was great sorrow among the people of
Troy, but they fought on.</p>

<p>Now Ulysses, another Greek of great fame, had built a
huge wooden horse. The Greeks left the horse standing
near the walls of Troy. Then they pretended to sail
home. The Trojans drew the great wooden beast within
the walls of the city. It was full of Greek warriors.
They climbed out at dead of night and opened the gates.
The Greeks rushed in, slew the Trojans, burned their city,
and carried home the beautiful Helen to be queen of
Sparta again. The ancient Greeks never tired of telling
their children the wonderful story of these brave deeds.</p>


<p><strong>264. Socrates, the Philosopher.</strong> After ages had gone
by the Greek nation still flourished, having improved in
many ways, especially in art and in education.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>One of
the
world's
greatest
men</strong></div>

<p>One of the wisest of their great men was Socrates.
Socrates was an ugly old man with a scolding wife. In
spite of these drawbacks he stands out as one of the foremost
teachers of the world. Socrates was truly a wise
man, because he knew that the wisest man knows very
little. He did not pretend to know things that he did
not know.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
method
Socrates
used</strong></div>

<p>Socrates taught, for the most part, by going among the
people and asking them questions. Some people liked
him, but some hated him because he asked questions that
led persons on from one point to another until they saw
their own mistakes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p>His enemies grew in numbers and brought false charges
that Socrates had not respected the gods of the city.</p>

<p>There came a
day when he was
called before the
city's judges, who
heard the charges
against him. The
judges decided
that he must die
by drinking a cup
of poison. Some
of the friends of
Socrates found a
way by which he
could escape
death. But the
brave old Greek had faced death on the battlefield and
was not afraid to die.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
death
of
Socrates</strong></div>

<p>Socrates believed that the laws of the city should be
obeyed even if they were unjust. He drank the fatal
cup while telling his friends and followers of a life beyond
the grave. It was a favorite doctrine of Socrates that
men would live again after the body died.</p>

<p>We know what Socrates taught from the writings of
his most famous pupil, Plato. These <cite>Dialogues</cite> of Plato's,
in the form of question and answer, are among the
greatest books ever written.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>A very
learned
man</strong></div>


<p><strong>265. Aristotle, the Scientist of Ancient Times.</strong> Aristotle
was one of the later Greeks. He was celebrated
for his learning. He was called a "Scientist," for he was
not simply a philosopher as Socrates and Plato were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Followed

<p>Aristotle was indeed a wonderful man. He studied
about every subject known to the ancients and won honors
in all subjects; people for centuries and centuries after
Aristotle's time accepted what he said and did not try
very hard to study further. They thought that the giant
mind of Aristotle had found out all there was to know.</p>

<p>Aristotle studied animals and plants, putting them in
different classes and finding out many of their characteristics.
He also knew a great deal about music and his <cite>Logic</cite>

<p><strong>266. The Father of Alexander the Great.</strong> Macedon
was a country just north of Greece. Its great king was
Philip, father of Alexander the
Great. Philip was a brave king
and had good soldiers. He taught
them to form in bodies sixteen
ranks deep and armed them with
lances or spears fourteen feet long.
A body of soldiers so formed and
armed was called a Macedonian
phalanx. "When the Macedonians

Homer, and it was said could repeat his poems by heart.</p>

<h3>HOW THE GREEKS TAUGHT MEN TO BE FREE</h3>


<p><strong>267. Self-Government among the Greeks.</strong> The
Greeks were not many in number, if we compare them
with modern nations. But we admire them because
they were free and had the most democratic government
in the ancient world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Greece a
city-state</strong></div>

<p>They lived in little cities located in the valleys shut in
by hills or mountains. Around their cities they built
strong walls to shut out dangerous enemies. There were
some benefits growing out of living in small cities. The
people could know each other. The men could come
together quickly and easily to talk of things needed for
the good of the city. Only a small part of the men and
women in a modern city can get together. These Greeks
could know the best men for office, for they were their
own neighbors. Now but a few men who want office can
be known to all the voters in a city, and still fewer who
want to run for governor or for president can be known
by all the voters of a state or country.</p>

<p>The most famous of the cities in ancient Greece were
Athens and Sparta. Their history is well known to us
because of the great deeds of their people. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
reason for remembering them is that the two cities were
so very different, as we shall see.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Greeks
their
own
rulers</strong></div>


<p><strong>268. The Government of the Cities.</strong> At first, just
as in the case of other nations, the Greeks had kings in
all their cities. But unlike the other nations, the Greeks
drove their kings out and made for themselves a kind of
government called a republic. This was the best and
wisest government for a people as intelligent as the
Greeks. In a republic all the people, or a majority of
them, take part in making and in carrying out the laws.
This is the kind of government we have.</p>

<p>But while a republican government is the best, it is
also the hardest to run. It demands that each one of its
citizens shall be educated so that he may be able to vote
wisely.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 513px;">

<div class="caption"><p>AN ATHENIAN SCHOOLBOY LEARNING
TO PLAY THE LYRE</p>

<p><em>From an Athenian vase</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The Greeks had a hard time keeping their self-government.
There were shrewd men among them who seized
the power in the city and
compelled the people to obey
them. Such a man the Greeks
called a "tyrant." A tyrant
was either good or bad. He
sometimes gave the people a
better government than they
had when they ruled themselves.
But the Greeks were
liberty-loving and liked to
govern themselves even
though their government was
worse than a tyrant's government.
So they generally drove out the tyrants and again
set up a government under rulers of their own choosing.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE DISCUS THROWER</p></div>
</div>


<p><strong>269. The Two Rival Cities, Athens and Sparta.</strong>
The people of Athens were the most democratic in all
Greece. The Spartans, on the other hand,
were the most soldier-like of the Greeks.
The Athenians loved new things while
the Spartans liked old ways best. The
Athenians made Athens the most beautiful
city in the Old World. The Spartans
cared nothing for beautiful things. They
loved only things that were useful.</p>

<p>All the citizens of Athens came together
to make the laws. In the center of their
city they met in their assembly, a semicircle
of stone seats rising one above
another. Here the men of Athens listened to their speakers.
Each speaker placed a wreath upon his head before
he began speaking.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
public
life of
the Athenians</strong></div>

<p>Often there were exciting debates between great
speakers called orators. They spoke eloquent words and
sometimes stirred people deeply. The Athenians enjoyed
these debates almost as much as they did their Greek plays.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 540px;">
<img src="images/i_458b.jpg" width="540" height="385" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE WRESTLERS</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Athenian
orators</strong></div>

<p>The people of Athens, because they made their laws
after debating them in the
assembly, placed emphasis on
public speaking. All the citizens
were taught how to speak
in public and how to appear
before the assembly. It was
natural for the best orators to
have the most influence. But
the people were keen and quick to see the difference
between orators who were interested only in winning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
applause and honor for themselves through their speeches
and the ones who were true patriots and spoke for the
good of the city.</p>

<p>Yet while the people of Athens trained their citizens to
make the laws they saw to it that their young men were
trained to be good soldiers. Training began with the
school boy. There were two schools, one called the music
school and the other the wrestling school.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
music
school</strong></div>

<p>In the music school the Greek boys did not study music
alone, but learned to read and write and do simple sums
in arithmetic. More than this, their teachers wanted
them to learn the poems written by blind Homer, their
wonderful old poet. They learned to play and sing. A
stringed instrument called a lyre was the favorite among
the Greeks.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
gymnasium</strong></div>

<p>In the wrestling school the boys learned to run, to
jump, to dance, and especially to throw the javelin. At
fifteen they attended the gymnasium where they were
taught the more difficult athletic games. This led up to
the next great event in the young man's life, his preparation
for becoming a citizen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Soldier-citizens</strong></div>

<p>This important event came at the age of eighteen. It
began with a great ceremony. The young men came
into the assembly before all the men of the city. Here
they were given a spear and shield. With their hands
raised they took an oath never to bring shame upon the
city nor to desert a companion in arms. They pledged
themselves to give over the city of Athens to their children
greater than when they had found it.</p>

<p>After this ceremony was over, the young men marched
away to be trained for two years more in the art of being
soldiers. When they had reached their twentieth year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
they returned to Athens to become citizens of the republic,
to work for its good, and to enjoy the pleasures of that
charming city.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Character
of
Pericles</strong></div>


<p><strong>270. Pericles, the Wise Statesman.</strong> Pericles lived in
the "Golden Age of Athens." He was born nearly 500
years before Christ. He was trained in the same manner
as any other boy in Athens. He became one of the first
orators of Greece and his ability as a speaker gave him
great power over his people. He became one of their
leading officers. Pericles stood for the people and
against those men of aristocratic ways who wanted the
city ruled by the few.</p>

</div>

<p>Cimon was the leader of the aristocracy. The people
of Athens voted to banish him. But after a time Pericles
had him brought back to Athens. This shows how very
kind-hearted Pericles was toward his
great political enemy.</p>

<p>For thirty years Pericles was the
most popular man in Athens. He
ruled the people kindly and well during
this time.</p>

<p>It was Pericles who made Athens
the City Beautiful. When you are
older you may read all about the
many wonderful buildings and monuments
he erected.</p>

<p>The rule of Pericles had one bad
result: He was so popular and had
been the great man in the government
so long that when he passed
away there was no one who could take his place. The
time in which he lived is often called the "Age of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
Pericles." After his death history handed his high ideas
on to Rome and the rest of the world. No doubt these
ideas influenced the great men of Rome.</p>

<p><strong>271. The Old Wars of the Greeks.</strong> The once greatest

its coast the Greeks had planted many cities, and they
naturally sent ships and soldiers to aid their kinsmen.</p>

<p>The king of the Persians, Darius by name, whom we
read about in the Bible, sailed with a great army across the
sea to Greece. One hundred thousand Persians met ten
thousand Greeks on the battlefield of Marathon. The
Greeks won.</p>

<p>The old folks and children among the Greeks waited
for the news with breathless anxiety. The minutes grew
into hours. At last they saw a runner coming. He was
covered with dust. He had been on the battlefield and
was running to tell the waiting people of the great victory.
He dropped dead as he called out, "Victory!" He had
run twenty-four miles!</p>

between high mountains and the sea. Here stood the

All the cities of Persia fell into his hands. Before he was
thirty years old, southwestern Asia and Egypt recognized
his rule. Alexandria, situated at the mouth of the Nile
River, was founded by him. It became a center of Greek
ideas and boasted the largest library in the Old World.</p>


<p><strong>273. Why Alexander Failed.</strong> Alexander's army
made its way to India. But its great general, now only
thirty-two, was drunk with power. He even permitted
the people he conquered to worship him as a god. He
loved the wine-cup too well and was stricken with a fever
and died.</p>

<p>There was no one to take his place, but much that was

<h3>WHEN ROME RULED THE WORLD</h3>

boot hanging from the Alps Mountains down into the
Mediterranean Sea. "Sunny Italy," people call it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>An old

<p>The ancient Romans all believed that their city,
Rome, was founded by a hero called Romulus. He had
a twin brother, Remus. A wicked uncle threw them
while babies into a basket and set it adrift on the river
Tiber. But the boys&mdash;so the story runs&mdash;were found
by a she-wolf that nursed them until they became men,
strong and cruel. With the aid of others as brave as
himself, Romulus founded the city of Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>How

<p><strong>275. Rome Becomes a Republic.</strong> Romulus was the
first of six kings. The people drove out the sixth because
he was cruel, and Rome became a republic. The republic
was ruled by two men called "consuls," aided by the
advice of great men called "senators." These senators
were among the wisest men in the Old World.</p>


<p><strong>276. Stories of Roman Heroes.</strong> The people of
Rome, like the Greeks, had their tales of what the
bold heroes of olden times had done.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Horatius

Roman throne. Bold Horatius took his stand on a narrow
bridge leading across the Tiber to the city. Here he met
the enemy, and defended the bridge with only his good
sword until the Roman soldiers broke down the bridge
behind him. When the bridge fell, he plunged into the
fast rolling stream and swam ashore.</p>

Cincinnatus. Rome's enemies were knocking at the very

Cincinnatus to head the army. They found him ploughing
on his little farm. He left his plough and oxen in
the field, took command of the Roman army, and by a
night attack completely defeated the enemy. He was the
most popular man in Rome and could have held any office
in the government. But he returned to his plow as if

A fierce war between the
rich and poor threatened to
destroy the republic itself.
The rich were selfish and
thought they should have
all the power. After a long
struggle the poor gained
some political rights by all
moving to a sacred hill and beginning to build a rival city.
The rich gave in and the poor in Rome had a right to
choose a man who could raise his hand in the assembly
and say: "I forbid," which he did by using the Latin
word, "veto." This is where we get our word "veto."</p>


<p><strong>278. The People Called Gauls Take Rome.</strong> For many
years the Romans quarreled among themselves. How
could they defend Rome from the great bands of brave

These were the Gauls. They were very large men who
dressed in skins of beasts. They defeated the Romans,
burned their cities, and murdered the people.</p>

<p>After a time the Gauls lived among the Romans and

conquered all the other tribes or peoples living in Italy.</p>

Carthage had been settled by the Phoenicians, the traders
of the ancient world. Carthage, the richest of their colonies,
was just across the Mediterranean from Rome. In
the days of her greatest power Carthage was said to have
nearly a million people. Rome and Carthage quarreled
about the island
of Sicily, lying
midway between
them, and Rome
was successful
in driving her
enemy out of the
island. The great
Carthaginian
general, Hannibal,
when only a boy
took a solemn
oath to carry on
war with Rome
without ceasing.
When he later
became a famous
general he still
remembered his
oath against
Rome. He gathered
a mighty
army from all Carthaginian colonies as well as from the
homeland. Soldiers came from all parts of Spain and Gaul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
From Africa came the finest body of cavalry in the world.
The strangest part of the body was a long line of war elephants
driven by
their riders to
trample down the
Roman soldiers
and to break
their solid lines.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>ROMANS PLOWING THE GROUND WHERE

</div>

<p>The army came
together in Spain
and marched over
the mighty Alps
into Italy. Their
march was slow
and hard. There
were no roads at
all through the
mountains. The army was often attacked by people
living in the mountains who hurled huge stones upon it.</p>

<p>After five months the army finally reached the plains
of Italy, though hundreds of brave soldiers had been lost.</p>

<p>Rome was stirred to her depths. A great army was
raised to meet the Carthaginians. But Rome had no
general like Hannibal. For fifteen years he remained
in Italy, defeating every general sent against him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>How
Hannibal
made
war</strong></div>

<p>Hannibal's greatest victory was on the field of Cannae.
Rome raised a mighty army, 86,000 men. Hannibal
had only 50,000, but he had faith in his veterans,
especially in the African horsemen. He arranged his
troops so that his center gave way easily. When the
Romans thought victory near, Hannibal's heavy troops on
each wing attacked them from both sides and his African<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
horsemen struck them in the rear. The Romans lost in
killed and wounded 70,000 men.</p>

<p>The Romans hit upon the plan of sending an army to
attack Carthage. Hannibal had to rush his troops home
to save his beloved city. In the great battle of Zama
Hannibal was defeated and Carthage fell.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The fate
of Carthage</strong></div>

<p>Rome would not permit a rival, so she wholly destroyed
Carthage, her great fleets of ships, her hoards of money,
her stores of goods and her great buildings. It is said
that Romans sowed salt where Carthage once stood so
that nothing might ever grow there.</p>

<h3>ROME CONQUERS THE WORLD BUT GROWS WICKED</h3>


<p><strong>280. How Rome Came to Win Victories.</strong> The wars
made great soldiers out of the Romans, who, now that
they had trained generals, began to conquer all the nations
about them. They invaded Macedonia, Greece, Asia,
and Africa, destroying the mighty nations which had
grown out of the work of Alexander the Great.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>How the
Romans
defeated
the
phalanx</strong></div>

<p>How do you suppose the Romans defeated the Macedonian
phalanx? The Roman generals planned the battle
with the Macedonians so that it always occurred in a forest
or on rough broken ground where the phalanx could not
stand in solid columns. With the phalanx already in
disorder the Romans charged and defeated them easily.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Roman
slaves</strong></div>


<p><strong>281. The Effect on the Romans.</strong> Long before the
Romans began to conquer other nations they were a
simple farmer-like people living by raising grain and
horses and cattle and sheep. But as soon as they began
to conquer other nations many of the Romans grew proud
and haughty. A great many grew rich from what they
took from the defeated nations. Hundreds of Romans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
who had been small farmers now lived on great farms.
On these farms or plantations the work was done by
slaves, who were prisoners taken in battle. Some of these
slaves were rude men taken in wars against half-savage
people. Others, like the Greeks, were well educated,
and really knew more than their masters. Those who
belonged to this class of slaves were treated kindly and
often played the part of tutors to the children of their
rich masters.</p>


<p><strong>282. The Rich and Poor Quarrel Again.</strong> The rich
men oppressed the poor in many ways. A great many
poor went to Rome to live because they found it hard to
make a living on their little farms. Then, too, the great
city was full of interesting doings. Besides, the city
did not permit her poor to starve. Great shiploads of
grain were brought from Egypt to feed them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Gracchi</strong></div>

<p>In Rome at this time there lived two brothers called the
Gracchi. They were both great orators and rose to high
positions in Rome. They saw their city was in a bad
way on account of the many poor that were flocking to it.</p>

<p>The Gracchi tried to change this by taking away from
the very rich landowners a part of their land and giving
it to the poor. The Gracchi wanted to make farmers
out of the poor. This plan roused the anger of the rich.
They raised riots against the brothers and both men were
killed. Rome never forgot the Gracchi, and even in our
time they are looked upon as noble men laboring for the
good of their country.</p>

<h3>THE ROMAN REPUBLIC BECOMES THE ROMAN EMPIRE</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Conditions
that
favored
Caesar</strong></div>


<p><strong>283. The Rise of Julius Caesar.</strong> When a country is
torn by quarrels between rich and poor, very often some
great man rises, seizes the government, and rules the
country himself. He may use the army in compelling all
parties to submit quietly to his rule. So it was in Rome.</p>

<p>Caesar was "tall and erect, with hooked nose, and
piercing glance." He made the common people believe
him to be their friend. They probably thought that he
was another Gracchus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Governor
of Gaul</strong></div>


<p><strong>284. Caesar Governor of Gaul.</strong> Caesar was chosen
consul, and then later made governor of Gaul. In Gaul
the people were half savage and were constantly fighting.</p>

<p>They made friends with Caesar because he helped them
defeat the Germans. The Germans were carrying fire
and sword into Gaul until Caesar put them to rout.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>War
with the
Gauls</strong></div>

<p>Caesar now decided that he must conquer all the country
of the Gauls. He called for more of the Roman
legions, such as had defeated the Macedonian phalanx.
One after another the tribes of Gaul were overcome.
Then suddenly, when Caesar least expected it, the Gauls
rose as one man and defeated the Romans. But Caesar
would not give up. He finally defeated the Gauls and sent
their great leader a prisoner to Rome.</p>

</div>


<p><strong>285. His Invasion of England.</strong> The Britons were
kinfolk of the Gauls and had sent them help in the fight
against Caesar. The Britons were also half savage, and
Caesar resolved to make them feel
the power of Rome. But Caesar
found the Britons ready for him
when his ships tried to land his
soldiers. The Britons, though
bravely fighting for native land,
were finally defeated.</p>

<p>Caesar made two invasions into
England, but when his soldiers
were needed at home, he withdrew.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Trouble

<p><strong>286. He Crosses the Rubicon.</strong>
There were other great generals
in Rome and they now became jealous of Caesar's
many victories and of his popularity. They prepared
to punish him. But Caesar was too quick for them. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
marched his army rapidly into Italy until he reached a
little stream called the Rubicon. To cross this stream
meant war&mdash;victory or defeat. He
stood awhile&mdash;so the story runs&mdash;in
deep study. "The die is cast," said
Caesar, and plunged into its waters.</p>


<p><strong>287. Caesar the Ruler of Rome.</strong>
Caesar's enemies fled from Rome, so
quickly did he come. He now held
the great city in his hands. He followed
his enemies and defeated them
in a great battle. Other armies were
raised against him, but he was the
final victor. He sent a famous dispatch
to Rome: "I came, I saw, I
conquered." Julius Caesar was now
master of the civilized world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The plot
against
Caesar</strong></div>

<p>But in ruling the world Caesar had changed Rome from
a republic into an empire. Many good Roman nobles
could never forget that fact. Caesar planned to give
Rome a good government. He was in many ways a wise
ruler. Still many people could not forgive him. So those
who believed Rome should still be a republic and others
who were merely jealous of him, planned to kill him. As
he came into the Senate Hall one day they stabbed him.</p>

<p>But the death of Rome's greatest man did not set her
free. Another and a worse tyrant ruled Rome.</p>

<h3>WHAT ROME GAVE TO THE WORLD</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>How
Rome
ruled</strong></div>


<p><strong>288. Great Lawmakers and Governors.</strong> Of all
the ancient nations Rome was the most famous in
establishing laws in regard to the ownership of property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
and in regard to the way men should act toward one
another.</p>

<p>Her consuls and senators were men skillful in planning
laws not only for Rome but for the nations which she had
conquered.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Colosseum</strong></div>


<p><strong>289. Romans Were Great Builders.</strong> The buildings
of Greece were beautiful but those of Rome were large
and strong. The Colosseum, built as a place of entertainment
for the people, was a gigantic affair seating
87,000 people. In this were held fights between gladiators,
men trained to kill each other, and between men
and wild beasts. The effect was to make the Romans
lovers of such cruel sports.</p>

<p>Other famous buildings put up by the Romans were
the Forum and the Pantheon. You may see remains of
these now in Rome. They are visited by hundreds of
Americans every year.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>ROMAN BRIDGE AND AQUEDUCT NEAR NIMES, FRANCE</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Roman
roads</strong></div>

<p>The Romans also built wonderful roads in all parts of
the empire for the use of armies and for travel and trade.
Some of these
roads are still
used. They
built strong
bridges over
the rivers and
erected aqueducts
in different
parts of the
empire. These
Roman aqueducts
brought good, pure water from the hills to supply
the needs of the townspeople.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>


<p><strong>290. The Romans Gave a Literature to the World.</strong>
Not all Romans were educated. All boys and girls did
not then go to school, as they do in America. Only the
sons of the well-to-do could become educated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Classic
Roman
writers</strong></div>

<p>Rome became famous for her great writers. Even
Julius Caesar found time to write the story of his war
against the Gauls. High school boys and girls read
Caesar's <em>Commentaries</em>. There was Vergil, a great poet,
who told the story of how the Greeks beat the Trojans.
Vergil made these Greek heroes the ancestors of the
Romans. Horace was another of Rome's great poets.
He amused the Romans "by his genial and quiet humor."
But Cicero was the great orator of Rome. His voice went
ringing down the senate halls as he challenged Catiline,
who had plotted to overthrow the republic.</p>


<p><strong>291. Rome Prepared the Way for the Spread of
Christianity.</strong> When Rome seemed sunk in wickedness
there came out of Palestine the story of Jesus. His
disciples were carrying the glad news everywhere over
the empire. Paul, the most learned of these followers of
Christ, carried the story to Greece and to Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Early
Christian
martyrs</strong></div>

<p>The emperors tried to stamp out the new religion, but
the more they opposed the more it grew. Hundreds of
Christians perished holding firm to the faith. Many were
destroyed by wild beasts in the Colosseum before the eyes
of thousands of Romans. But the new religion appealed
to many, and especially to the poorer classes. The
Emperor Constantine (305 A. D.) soon accepted the new
religion and gave it protection. It then spread rapidly.
Priests were sent into the villages to preach and to set
up churches. Above the priest was a bishop in charge
of all the churches in a district or province.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span></p>

<p>The government of the new church was formed like that
of the empire and became strong. Other religions were
driven out. In time the many offices of the empire were
in the hands of the priests or under their influence. Many
years later these two governments of the church and the
empire quarreled over their rights to rule the people.</p>

<h3>THE DOWNFALL OF ROME</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>How the
Teutonic
tribes
lived</strong></div>


<p><strong>292. The Coming of the Huns and Teutons.</strong> North
of the Alps, beyond the Danube and the Rhine, and
between the North Sea and the Black Sea, was a vast
region of wild lands. Here the German or Teutonic tribes
had lived for hundreds of years. They had made little
advance in ways of living. They still dwelt in poor
villages. They loved to fight, or waste their time in
idleness and feasts. They were noted for their love of
liberty and pure family life. At the time of the invasions
(4th century) they were learning to live in towns, to
unite in confederations, and to be ruled by elected kings.
They had so increased in numbers that more land was
needed to afford them a living. This was the main
cause of their moving south to the Roman frontiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Gradual
coming
of the
Germans</strong></div>

<p>For three hundred years the Germans were restless in
their northern homes. But the Roman armies were
strong enough to keep them beyond the Danube. Some
had come over as soldiers in the Roman legions. By 330
half the troops were German. Some of the more peaceful
Germans were allowed to make settlements within the
empire. Other Germans came in as slaves, but mainly
to work on the farms.</p>

<p>By the end of the fourth century after Christ the
Romans had become too weak to keep the Germans back.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Battle of
Chalons</strong></div>

<p>But the Germans were gentle compared with the fierce
Huns from Asia who made the next great invasion
into Europe. And
under their terrible
chief, Attila,
they swept over
Europe like firebrands,
laying
waste all they
could not carry
away. At last
the Germans and
the Romans united and defeated the Huns at Chalons
(451). The Huns moved eastward, passed through northern
Italy, and soon reëntered Asia. Europe was saved.</p>


<p><strong>293. End of the Empire.</strong> Other German tribes
entered the empire, took possession of the lands, and even
formed governments under their chiefs. In a quarrel
over lands the German troops removed the Roman emperor
and declared their chief, Odoacer, king (476). This
marks the end of the Roman Empire and the rise of the
kingdom of Italy, though the present United Kingdom,
formed after centuries of division, among small, jealous
city states, is only sixty years old.</p>

<p>Other invasions went on for many years. Europe was
in disorder and confusion for nearly four hundred years.
It was a time of seeding, when the rough, brave, liberty-loving
German peoples were intermarrying with the
Greeks and Romans and learning from them the finer
ways of living. From this fusion a new society was built
on the ruins of the old, as shown in the nations of Italy,
France, and Spain.</p>

<h3>THE ANGLES AND SAXONS IN GREAT BRITAIN</h3>


<p><strong>294. The Britons.</strong> There were already two groups of
people in these islands. Under the rule of the Romans
one group, the Britons, had been weakened as fighters.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Britons

<p>Rome called her legions out of Britain to fight the
Germans. This left the Britons without good soldiers
to keep order and the tribes began fighting one another.
One tribe, the Britons proper, invited bands of Jutes from
Denmark (449) to help them. After the Britons had
forced back their enemies the Jutes refused to go away.
They took possession of the land, making it their home.</p>

<p><strong>295. Coming of the Anglo-Saxons.</strong> Other German
tribes, chiefly the wild Angles and Saxons, now came over
from Europe. The new tribes soon brought the Britons
under their rule. They gave their names to the land
they had taken&mdash;Angle land or England. The Angles
and Saxons are the forefathers of the "English" people.
The Britons who would not submit were driven into the
lands to the west known as Wales, and became the "Welsh."</p>


<p><strong>296. Rome Brings Christianity to the Germans.</strong>
When the western Roman Empire passed away in 476,
the church remained the only strong central government
in all that vast territory. It acted as a steady light
when all about was dark and changing. Its priests came
to be the only educated class, giving it great influence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Clovis,
king of
the
Franks,
converted</strong></div>

<p>Even before the invasions began, missionaries went
among the German tribes on the frontiers to preach the
religion of Christ. Many of the Germans had accepted
the new religion either before or soon after entering Roman
territory. Clovis, king of the Franks, was influenced
by his Christian wife to accept the new religion.
His army followed, and was baptized with its leader.</p>

<p>Missionaries under Augustine were sent from Rome to
England. Through their earnest preaching and noble
living the king of Kent and his followers accepted the new
religion. A church was built at Canterbury. Others
carried on the work until all England had accepted
Christianity. Other missionaries went to the northern
Germans, and many of these people became Christians.</p>

<p>These early missionaries were mostly monks. Their
homes (monasteries) were like small settlements among
the people. They not only preached the new religion,
but showed people better ways of farming and living.
In their schools, they taught people to read and write.</p>

lived on friendly terms
with the church. They
grew strong and settled
down to a more orderly
and quiet way of living.
Their first great king,
Charles Martel, the
Hammer, checked the
invasion of the Mohammedans
at Tours (732),
and again Europe and Christianity were saved. But the
greatest of all the leaders of the Franks was Charlemagne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>

<p>Charlemagne, or

"... next to his
skin a linen shirt and
linen breeches, and
above these a tunic fringed with silk; while hose fastened
by bands covered his lower limbs, and shoes his feet,
and he shielded his shoulders and chest in winter by a
close-fitting coat of otter or marten skin. Over all he
cast a blue coat: always too he had a sword girt about
him."</p>

<p>Charles ate and drank with care, never taking too
much of either food or drink. During his meals his

of Augustine. He was a good speaker, easily understood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
He loved learning, but had little education himself.
He had the famous School of the Palace in his own home
to educate his own children and those of the nobles. Wise
teachers like Peter of Pisa, and Alcuin of England were
brought to his court. He helped the priests in their study
and in building schools. Charles loved the church and
gave much to aid its educational and religious work.
He really brought learning to the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Charlemagne's
wars</strong></div>

<p>Charles the Great was for three years ruler with his
father (768-771), then sole ruler until 814. His kingdom
was surrounded on all sides by fierce enemies. Most of
his long rule was taken up in fighting the wild Germans
to the north and east, the Arabs in Spain, or the Lombards
and others to protect the church in Italy. He was a
great warrior. Before his death he had brought most of
western Europe under his rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Crowned
Emperor
of Rome</strong></div>


<p><strong>298. The Crowning of Charlemagne.</strong> So successful
was he that it seemed the Roman Empire was again to
live in the memories of men. God was surely with him.
How simple it then seemed to bestow the symbol of divine
blessing upon Charles! On Christmas day, 800, Charles
was in Rome. And on that sacred day of the Christians
he entered the great church and knelt in prayer before
the altar. In that solemn moment the pope, as the
messenger on earth of God, quietly stepped to where
Charles was kneeling. Lifting the crown which he held
in his hands, he placed it upon the head of the king of the
Franks and proclaimed him Emperor of Rome (800).
What glorious memories it must have brought to the
thousands gathered there! In their joy they cried out:
"Long life and victory to the mighty Charles, the great
and pacific emperor of the Romans, crowned of God!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>How he
governed</strong></div>


<p><strong>299. The Ruler Charlemagne.</strong> Charles was a great
ruler as well as soldier. He divided his territory into
districts over each of which a count ruled. An army
officer cared for all military matters. At certain times
inspectors passed over the several districts. These three
officers reported directly to Charles and were checks on
the conduct of each other.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>His just
laws</strong></div>

<p>Some of the orders which he sent to his officers show how
great and just a ruler he was. He orders that "all shall
live entirely in accordance with God's precept, justly and
under a just rule, and each one shall be admonished to
live in harmony with his fellows." Let no one "do injury
to the churches of God, or to the poor, or the widows, or
the wards, or any Christian." He then lays down the
rules of living for the clergy, nuns, bishops, and other
church officers, that their lives may be holy and their
influence good.</p>

<p>He wanted to see justice done all over his kingdom&mdash;to
the poor as well as to the rich. Wonderful stories, some
true, have been woven about the name of the great
emperor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Why his
empire
fell</strong></div>

<p>He built up a great empire, but it was too great to live
long. There were too many races with different ways of
living, and the provinces were too far apart. When the
strength and wisdom of his hand and head passed away in
death, the great empire began to crumble and fall apart.</p>

<p><strong>300. The Vikings or Sea-Rovers.</strong> The Northmen
lived in the lands of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
They lived on the inlets of the ocean, or viks, and were
called "vikings." Their boats were long, and each one
had a high prow with the head of a dragon or other
fierce-looking animal upon it. They drove their vessels by
sail or oar. Often there were as many as fifty rowers in a
boat, their bright shields hanging over the sides. When
the sun shone on them they looked like great moving
lights. The Northmen were great sea-rovers and pirates.</p>

<p>In the eighth and ninth centuries these Northmen or

the northern part of France and settled on the river
Seine. They were called "Normans," and this region is
now Normandy. Others sailed to the west and founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
Iceland and Greenland. And their "sagas" or records tell

be lasting.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The

<p>The Northmen, called

had made many attacks
on the coasts of England.
Now they came
in armies to take the
land for homes. As they
were heathen they took
the riches from the
churches and slew the
priests. They captured
place after place, driving
the English before them, until the greater part of England
fell into their hands. Young Alfred, king of Wessex,
finally forced them to stop. While he drove them back
some distance, he could not make them leave England.</p>

<h3>ALFRED THE GREAT</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Childhood
of
Alfred</strong></div>


<p><strong>301. Alfred the Boy.</strong> Alfred was born in 849. His
mother was a good woman who gave much time and
care to her children. Alfred learned early to read and
to love books. A story is told of how Alfred won a beautiful
book as a prize from his mother for learning to read
it sooner than the other children. He spent much time
in learning about wise men, in order to become wise himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Alfred
fights the
Danes</strong></div>

<p>As he grew older he found other serious work to do. He
aided his brother Ethelred, king of Wessex, to give battle
to the Danes, who were moving south. In one battle
Alfred led the English "with the rush of a wild boar,"
and defeated the Danes. Later the Danes drove them
back and killed the English king. Alfred now became
king of Wessex (871).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
story of
the cakes</strong></div>


<p><strong>302. Alfred as King.</strong> Soon after Alfred became king
his army was beaten and his men fled. With a little band
of followers he hid in the marshes and there built a fort
on an island. A story is told of how he was lost while
wandering alone, and asked for shelter at the hut of a
herdsman. The good wife told him to watch some cakes
on the fire while she was busy. Alfred was bending his
bow and arrows, and forgetting the cakes, let them burn.
When she came back and saw the burnt cakes the good
wife scolded the king.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Can't you mind the cakes, man?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As soon as 'tis the turn."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Of course she did not know he was the king or she would
not have scolded him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Makes a
treaty
with the
Danes</strong></div>

<p>The next spring Alfred raised a large army, drove the
Danes back, and forced them to make peace. By this
treaty, and another later one, the Danes were given that
part of England north and west of the river Thames.
Alfred and his people ruled over the country south of
them. The land of the Danes was called "Danelagh."
They soon settled down to till the soil. Years later they
became Christians and intermarried with the English.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>STATUE OF ALFRED
AT WINCHESTER</p></div>
</div>

<p>To protect England from other sea-rovers, Alfred now
built many ships, and thus became the father of the English
navy. The army was also made larger. Later,
Vikings again reached the shores of
England, but Alfred's navy beat them
off. Peaceful times now gave Alfred a
chance to help his people in other ways.</p>


<p><strong>303. What Alfred Did for England.</strong>
It is difficult to know what the law
is if it is not written, and injustice is
often done to the people. Alfred now
began the work of collecting and changing
the laws of England. It is interesting
to know what he thought of his
work, as shown in his writing: "I,
Alfred, gathered these laws together,
and commanded many of them to be
written which our forefathers held,
those which seemed to me good. And
many of those which seemed to me
not good, I rejected, and in other wise
commanded them to be held. For I
durst not venture to set down in writing much of my
own, for it was unknown to me what if it would please
those who should come after us."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Advances
learning</strong></div>

<p>In those far-away days learning and schools were found
in monasteries and in the churches. When the Danes
came they destroyed most of these buildings. The
people, therefore, were growing up in ignorance. Alfred
felt then, as we feel now, that the people should be educated.
So he invited wise men from other countries to
come to England to teach his people. He built many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
churches and monasteries, and set up schools where the
people might go to learn. But there must be books for
them to read.</p>

<p>The learning of that day was mostly in Latin. Besides
the priests and monks very few could read that language.
"I wondered extremely," said Alfred, "that the
good and wise men who were formerly all over England,
and had perfectly learned all the books, did not wish to
translate them into their own tongue."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Translates
Latin
books
into
English</strong></div>

<p>He now began earnestly the work of making English
books for his people. He translated a book containing
a history of the world, and an account of two voyages
to the north seas. He then put into English the famous
book <cite>Bede's History of England</cite>. A book on religion by
Pope Gregory the Great, and another of wise sayings,
were soon after translated into English. In this way
Alfred helped his people to learn to read, and to read
good books. The English people have saved these works
that their children for many generations to come might
learn good things from them. Now, however, they must
be translated into the English of our day before most of
us can read them, for our language has changed greatly
since Alfred's time.</p>

<p>Alfred also helped his people to learn new trades, and
to do their work better in those trades they already knew.
He had skilled workers from other countries come to
England to help his people.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>King
Alfred's
purpose</strong></div>

<p>Alfred was a true and good man. He loved his home
and his people. He said: "To sum up all, it has ever
been my desire to live worthily while I was alive, and
after my death to leave to those that should come after
me my memory in good works."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>His time
well-ordered</strong></div>

<p>The daily life of the king was orderly. The twenty-four
hours were divided into three parts; eight hours were given
to the business of the people (governing), eight hours to
study and prayer, and eight hours to exercise and rest.
"As he had no clock, he measured out his time by burning
candles, each of which lasted for four hours. In order
that the candles might burn evenly and mark the time
properly, he enclosed them in lanterns of thin horn"
which he had invented.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Alfred

<p>Good King Alfred died in 901. A thousand years later
the English raised a statue to him at Winchester. Because

Great." He is one of the noblest men in all history.</p>

<p><strong>304. England Conquered Many Times.</strong> England had
been conquered by the Romans, the Anglo-Saxons, and
the Danes. Now she was conquered for
the last time. The people who defeated
her were the Normans of France. We
have seen them come into France when
the Normans scattered from their native
lands in the north of Europe.</p>

<p>After Alfred died several kings ruled
in England. When Harold was chosen
king, the Duke of Normandy claimed
the throne of England. He made this
claim on the ground that the former
English king had promised it to him.
The Duke of Normandy has always been
called William the Conqueror. He was a stern man who
knew how to rule and fight. To establish his claim to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
the English throne he gathered together an army, crossed
the Channel, and landed at Senlac, near Hastings.</p>

<p><strong>305. The Battle of
Hastings (1066).</strong> Harold
had gathered his soldiers
to resist the Normans.
They fought bravely, as
any good soldiers do
when defending their
native land. "All day
long they stood stubbornly
together on a
hilltop and beat back
every attack with their
swords and axes." When
Harold was wounded,
his men still fought on.
William of Normandy
now thought of a trick. He ordered his soldiers to pretend
to be beaten and to retreat. This they did. The
English soldiers now rushed forward to follow on their
heels and cut down as many as they could. What was
their dismay to see the Normans turning around and
cutting down the English! When night came the English
army was no more.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Character

<p>England had staked all and had lost. Most of the
country gave up. William was crowned king. He
divided the land among his nobles, and England, which
was democratic under the Anglo-Saxon became aristocratic
under the rule of William. The Normans built the
huge castles and cathedrals that dot the face of England.
From their castles they lorded it over the Anglo-Saxon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
But slowly this condition changed. After many years
Normans and Anglo-Saxons commenced to grow friendly
and their sons and
daughters began to
marry one another.
The fusion of these
two classes made the
English people a more
hardy and daring
race than before.</p>

the Normans may be said to have been conquered by
the Anglo-Saxons. The Anglo-Saxon way of doing
things belonged to the shire, the county, and the township.
The people were called together in the different
districts and practiced self-government.</p>

<h3>THE STRUGGLE FOR THE GREAT CHARTER</h3>


<div class="sidenote"><strong>Lawlessness
of
the
nobles</strong></div>


<p><strong>306. Henry II a Great Ruler.</strong> Nearly a hundred
years had gone by since William the Conqueror ruled
England. There was great confusion in England. The
Norman nobles were doing about as they pleased. They
rode forth from their castles with their little armies and
attacked each other, or attacked the citizens of a town,
sometimes murdering them.</p>

<p>Then Henry II, the grandson of William the Conqueror,
came to the throne. He was like his ancestor in many ways.
He could brook no opposition. He was short and powerfully
built. "He had red hair, a bull neck, and bow legs."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
He was careless about his dress, but was a hard worker.
He saw that England needed order first. He therefore
first of all compelled the nobles to behave by destroying
some of their castles and driving the soldiers, which they
had hired, back to France.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>Trial by
jury</strong></div>

<p>He changed the way of finding out whether or not a
man was guilty. Instead of employing the "ordeal by
fire," by water, or by battle, he sent judges around to
different places. These judges called together sixteen
good men who told them about those who they thought
had broken the law. These men made up the Grand Jury.</p>

<p>Twelve other men were selected to examine into all
the facts of a given case before the man was condemned
or set free. This way of "trying men by jury" was a
great improvement over the old way. In these ways
Henry II brought the evildoers in England, whether
high or low, to obey the law or be severely punished.
England was now once more an orderly country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>John a
worthless
king</strong></div>


<p><strong>307. King John and the Pope.</strong> The son of Henry II,
John, was about the worst king that England ever had.
John was bad; he would not keep a promise, was a great
liar, was cruel, was cowardly, was a traitor and a tyrant.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>All the
churches
closed</strong></div>

<p>Ever since the days of William the Conqueror the
kings of England had been the dukes of Normandy. In
a war with the French king, John lost all of Normandy.
The Pope named as Archbishop of Canterbury a man
whom John opposed. The Pope and John quarreled.
"The Pope closed every church in England. No bells
rang to call the people to prayer or to service on the
Sabbath. No priest could preach. The dead could
not be buried; the living might not marry. Every
church stood silent and grass grew about the doors."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pope called on the king of France to take John's
place, for in the eyes of the Pope John was no longer king
of England. John turned about and begged for the
Pope's mercy. He promised to submit to his will and to
pay him a large amount of money each year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
barons
revolt</strong></div>


<p><strong>308. John Compelled to Grant Magna Charta.</strong> John
was so cruel to his own people that the barons rose in
revolt. Their forefathers had been free, and "why not
we?" they asked. John only "laughed in his sleeve."
But the barons meant business. They met in a meadow,
called Runnymede, and summoned the king to face them.
He came.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
meeting
at Runnymede</strong></div>

<p>It was a great scene. There stood the barons with
their soldiers not far away. Their faces showed their
anger and their decision to have their rights. The head
of every house had his great banner which he had carried
to victory on many a field of battle. But worse than all,
there John saw the very Archbishop of Canterbury whom
he had refused to permit to enter England. John was
furious, but he could not help himself, for he heard the
clanking of cold steel all around him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>What the
Great
Charter
meant</strong></div>

<p>The barons told him plainly that he must give all
England a pledge to do right according to England's law.
They told him that this promise must be signed by his
own hand and on the signed paper he must place the royal
seal. This great paper is called the Great Charter&mdash;"Magna
Charta" (1215). Englishmen love it and have
often shed their blood in defense of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The
Petition
of Right</strong></div>

<p>For more than four hundred years this charter was the
foundation of the rights of Englishmen. But they found
in the charter only the old laws which had come down
from good Edward the Confessor (1042-1066). In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
1628 another English king, Charles I, was compelled by
Parliament to sign another charter, called the "Petition
of Right." In this new pledge to the English people
they found nothing very new but mostly the old laws or
principles contained in Magna Charta.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><strong>The Bill
of Rights</strong></div>

<p>When James II was driven from the throne by the
English people they drew another charter, which King
William signed (1689). This was called the "Bill of
Rights." In this there were not many new things, but
it contained mostly the principles of Magna Charta
and the Petition of Right. Besides, this last charter
contained several rules which made Parliament superior
to the king.</p>

<p>When the American people after their Revolution came
to make a Constitution, they put in it many principles
found in the English Bill of Rights. We ought to admire
and love our Constitution because it contains ideas that
have been tried out for more than ten centuries.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
